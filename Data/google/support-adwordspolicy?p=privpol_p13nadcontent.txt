Personalized advertising is a powerful tool that improves advertising relevance for users and increases ROI for advertisers. Because it works by employing online user data to target users with more relevant advertising content, it can provide an improved experience for users and advertisers alike.
When employing user behavior or interest data to provide more relevant ad content it’s important to handle that information appropriately. We recognize that certain interests are sensitive and that targeting based on them could negatively impact user experience.
With this in mind and based on the sensitivities associated with user ad targeting, we’ve identified policy standards for all personalized advertising targeting features. These standards do not replace our other advertising policies (for example, for Google Ads or Shopping) and advertisers are still responsible for complying with all applicable advertising policies, in addition to Personalized advertising policies. Advertisers are also required to comply with our policies for European Union user consent, where applicable.
Google's privacy policy applies to all Google features and dictates how Google collects, uses, and protects user data. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies.

Personalized advertising content policy principles

Sensitive interest categories are restricted in personalized ads. We define sensitive interest categories in terms of the following content policy principles:


Legal restrictions: Ads must comply with the law.
Personal hardships: Ads shouldn’t target users in ways that exploit their difficulties or struggles.
Identity and belief: Ads shouldn’t target users based on categories prone to systemic discrimination or unfair stigmas.
Sexual interests: Ads shouldn’t target users based on inherently private sexual interests or experiences.
Access to opportunities: Ads shouldn’t limit access to opportunities by leveraging unfair societal biases when targeting users with specific content categories.







Restrictions based on personalized advertising targeting feature
Personalized ads policies apply differently depending on the targeting feature used. For all targeting features, there are two components:


targeting users, which refers to the groups of users you've chosen to see your ads and includes all aspects of creating or selecting those groups.
promoting products and services, which refers to the specific content in your ad or on your landing page.


Depending on whether the targeting feature is an advertiser-curated audience or a predefined Google audience, personalized ads sensitive interest categories may or may not apply to promoting products and services.


For all personalized ads targeting features, we don’t allow targeting users based on sensitive interest categories.
For advertiser-curated audiences, where advertisers can customize, curate, or upload their own audiences, advertisers are also not allowed to promote products and services from sensitive interest categories.
For pre-defined Google audiences, where Google manages the development and curation of policy-compliant audiences based on information across Google properties, advertisers are allowed to promote products and services from sensitive interest categories.





Effect of the policy
Advertisers promoting products and services that fall within sensitive interest categories are unable to use advertiser-curated audiences. This helps ensure that sensitive interest categories aren’t inadvertently used for targeting audiences. Because predefined Google audiences are expressly configured without sensitive user signals, all advertisers are allowed to use them, even if they promote sensitive interest categories.
See the following non-exhaustive list of targeting features and how personalized ads policies apply.



Advertiser-curated audiences
If you’re an advertiser that promotes products and services in sensitive interest categories you’ll be unable to use the following targeting features.

Personal hardships

We understand that users don’t want to see ads that exploit their personal struggles, difficulties, and hardships, so we don’t allow personalized advertising based on these hardships.

Identity and belief

We consider identity and belief systems to be deeply personal and complex. They’re highly dependent on diversity of cultural norms, geography, history, and personal life experiences. We also understand that how one identifies or what one believes can be used to segment users based on judgments or stigmas.
We want ads to provide a positive experience and to be informed by users’ interests rather than by who they’re perceived to be as a person, so we don’t allow personalized advertising based on a user’s fundamental or intrinsic self-identity or their belief systems. Such identities and beliefs can include inherently private classifications of one’s self; classifications susceptible to stigmas, discrimination, or harassment; membership within groups that are susceptible to stigmas, discrimination, or prejudices; and personally held belief systems.
We don’t allow targeting users based on identity and belief, as outlined in the following sensitive interest categories. Depending on the targeting feature used, you also may not be allowed to promote products and services in the following sensitive interest categories.

  Sexual interests

We understand that sexual interests are inherently private and, depending on cultural norms, not often candidly discussed. We believe in maintaining the privacy of a user’s sexual interests, so we don’t allow personalized advertising that targets users based on their personal sexual interests, experiences, activities, or preferences. Such interests include sexual behaviors, activities, or products used when having sex. Additionally, we don’t allow categories that are sexually suggestive or intended to sexually arouse.
We don’t allow targeting users based on sexual interests, as outlined in the following sensitive interest categories. Depending on the targeting feature used, you also may not be allowed to promote products and services in the following sensitive interest categories.

Birth control in personalized advertising

Examples: condoms, oral contraceptive pill, contraceptive sponge







Sexual content
 All sexual content as defined in the Google Ads Sexual content policy. 
If the Sexual content policy and the Personalized advertising sexual interests policy differ on how each treats a category, the Personalized advertising sexual interests policy takes precedence over the Sexual content policy with respect to how the category can be used for targeting and personalized ads.


   

  

Access to opportunities

We believe access to social and economic opportunities is fundamental for individual well-being, social status and quality of life. We also recognize that historic discrimination and societal biases have resulted in some segments of society having unequal access to these opportunities. 
Therefore, in an effort to improve inclusivity for users disproportionately affected by society’s biases, we don’t allow some categories of products or services to be targeted to specific audiences. This is in addition to existing ads policies that prohibit discrimination and personalized ads policies that prohibit use of Identity and Belief categories. See below for specific examples of what we don't allow.

Countries: United States, Canada
In the United States and Canada, the following sensitive interest categories cannot be targeted to audiences based on gender, age, parental status, marital status, or ZIP code. 

Housing in personalized ads

 Homes for sale or rental, where a home is defined as a place a person would reside. This includes products or services enabling the sale or rental of homes. 


Examples: housing listing sites, individual houses for sale or rental, real estate services





Employment in personalized ads 

 Employment opportunities or hiring a person for a job.* 


Examples: ads for jobs, job recruitment sites, job listing sites


*A subset of predetermined U.S. government advertisers promoting employment in personalized ads are permitted to target restricted audiences under specific conditions. If the targeting is based on a bona fide occupational qualification for a government job, which is defined under U.S. law as a qualification that is reasonably necessary for normal function of the job, these identified U.S. government advertisers may target restricted audiences. 



Credit in personalized ads

 Offers of credit or products or services related to credit lending. 


Examples: credit cards, loans including home loans, car loans, appliance loans, short-term loans





   

  


Personalized advertising data collection and use policies 
These policies define requirements for data collection and use in personalized ads. They apply in addition to the Google ads policies for data collection and use. 
You aren't allowed to do the following:

 Run ads that collect or contain personally identifiable information (PII), unless using an ad format provided by Google and designed for that purpose


Examples: Collecting email addresses, telephone numbers, or credit card numbers within the ad itself


 Use or associate PII with remarketing lists, cookies, data feeds, or other anonymous identifiers
 Share PII with Google through remarketing tags or any product data feeds that might be associated with ads
 Send Google precise location information without first obtaining users' consent
 Use a remarketing list that targets an overly narrow or specific audience. This includes the case where combining a remarketing list with other targeting criteria (such as geographic limitations or other user segmentation) results in an ad targeted to a relatively small number of users. Learn more about remarketing list size requirements.

For Remarketing


You can choose to disable the collection of remarketing data for users who do not wish to view personalized ads by using the parameter: allow_ad_personalization_signals. Learn how to modify the global site tag in order to disable the collection of remarketing data for specific users.
When using remarketing, re-engagement, or similar audiences features, you're required to include specific information in your privacy policy.
Google may include in-ad notice labels to disclose personalized advertising to our users, and we may display to users which remarketing lists they're on, along with the corresponding domain name. You must not modify or obscure these notices. If you want to implement your own in-ad notice, it must only be done in compliance with relevant industry standards.
Google won't allow another advertiser to use your remarketing lists or similar audiences lists without your consent.
