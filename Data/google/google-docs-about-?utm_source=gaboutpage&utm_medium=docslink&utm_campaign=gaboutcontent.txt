See what you can do with Google Docs 











                    Seamless collaboration, from anywhere
                  


                      Edit together in real-time with easy sharing, and use comments, suggestions, and action items to keep things moving. Or use to pull relevant people, files, and events into your online Docs for rich collaboration.
                    




   








                    Write faster with built-in intelligence
                  


                      Assistive features like Smart Compose help you write faster with fewer errors, so you can focus on ideas. And save time with spelling and grammar suggestions, voice typing, and quick document translation.
                    




   







                    Seamlessly connect to your other Google apps
                  


                      Docs is thoughtfully connected to other Google apps you love, saving you time. Reply to comments directly from Gmail, embed charts from Google Sheets, and easily share via Google Meet. You can even search the web and Google Drive for relevant content and images, directly from Docs.
                    




   






                    Bring collaboration and intelligence to other file types
                  


                      Easily edit Microsoft Word files online without converting them, and layer on Docsâ enhanced collaborative and assistive features like action items and Smart Compose. You can also import PDFs, making them instantly editable.
                    




   










                  Do more with add-ons
                

                  Access a variety of third-party applications, right from Docs. Whether itâs an e-signature app or project management tool, open it from Docs to work faster.
                




                  Work on fresh content
                

                  With Docs, everyoneâs working on the latest version of a document. And with edits automatically saved in version history, itâs easy to track or undo changes.
                




                  Stay productive, even offline
                

                  You can access, create, and edit Docs even without an internet connection, helping you stay productive from anywhere.
                








              Security, compliance, and privacy
            

   






                      Secure by default
                    

                      We use industry-leading security measures to keep your data safe, including advanced malware protections. Docs is also cloud-native, eliminating the need for local files and minimizing risk to your devices.
                    



                      Encryption in transit and at rest
                    

                      All files uploaded to Google Drive or created in Docs are encrypted in transit and at rest.
                    



                      Compliance to support regulatory requirements
                    

                      Our products, including Docs, regularly undergo independent verification of their security, privacy, and compliance controls.
                    




                    Private by design
                  

                    Docs adheres to the same robust privacy commitments and data protections as the rest of Google Cloudâs enterprise services.
                  


                      You control your data.
                    


                      We never use your Docs content for ad purposes.
                    


                      We never sell your personal information to third parties.
