But recently, the swiping function just randomly stops working mid-text. It used to happen every once in awhile, and I'd have to back out of what I was doing & then it would be resolved when I came back. But now, it's happening almost every time I use it, so while it still does resolve with exiting/coming back in, it's so frequent that it's no longer worth it to keep using. Disappointing because I really loved this keyboard!164 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoArchan Joshimore_vert Flag inappropriateJuly 18, 2022Some features are lacking or less polished in comparison to other apps. For example, Samsung's keypad app has a vastly superior cursor navigation/control when long pressing the space bar key. In case of GBoard, one can only navigate along the current line, but in Samsung Keyboard, user can navigate in all 4 directions. This is VERY convenient when you want to quickly and accurately navigate multiple lines. Please add this feature.254 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoStephen Maymore_vert Flag inappropriateJuly 20, 2022I love the Google keyboard and the voice input capability. To me it is much easier to use than the Samsung keyboard that is the default with my Galaxy S22 Ultra. It uses one line less of the screen, which can be important with some apps. The one thing that really bugs me about it is there are no cursor control keys as there are with the Samsung keyboard. Yes, I understand that I can slide the space bar, but I would greatly prefer having dedicated cursor keys. You got that, Google? Fix this!50 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacySimilar appsarrow_forwardMicrosoft SwiftKey KeyboardSwiftKey4.1starTraditional Chinese KeyboardLinpus Technologies, Inc.3.4starSpanish for AnySoftKeyboardAnySoftKeyboard4.4starGrammarly - Grammar KeyboardGrammarly, Inc.4.1starFleksy fast emoji keyboard appThingthing Ltd3.9starGinger Keyboard - Emoji, GIFsGingerSoftware Inc.4.4starMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle ChatGoogle LLC2.5starGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.1starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube KidsGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
