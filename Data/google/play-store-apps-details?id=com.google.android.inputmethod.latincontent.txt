I never had a problem up until now. All of a sudden in the last week or so, the cursor will jump to random places in whatever I'm typing, throw predictive text wherever the cursor lands, backspace in the middle of words, etc. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the keyboard, but it worked even worse somehow. If I could give 0/5, I would. It's pretty unusable. Stuck defaulting to the Samsung keyboard.756 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoTracy Greenmore_vert Flag inappropriateMay 26, 2022I can't back up and correct anything. The curser jumps to the end of the sentence when trying to backspace or insert text. When it does go to the end of the sentence and I to click on backspace, it doubles the letters in the word the cursor is next to. I can no longer highlight a word and click on the capitalize/shift option. Please fix. Until such time, I'll have to go back to the stock keyboard. This is NOT a phone issue. It's happening with so many others' regardless of point manufacturer.292 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSamantha Barnesmore_vert Flag inappropriateJune 4, 2022My favorite keyboard as of now. I like the size and spacing for the keys and the variety of customizations available. The talk to text is also the best I've found after going through four other keyboard apps. I would prefer to give 4.5 out of 5, and the only reason for the lack of .5 of a star is because adding words to your personal dictionary is quite buried within the settings, but at least it's there, and every now and then it seems to spaz on certain words. Always room for improvement.14 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacyMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC3.9starGoogle ChatGoogle LLC4.0starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle Find My DeviceGoogle LLC4.4starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
