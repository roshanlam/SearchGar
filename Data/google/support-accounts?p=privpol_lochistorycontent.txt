You're signed in to your Google Account,
You have turned on Location History, and
The device has Location Reporting turned on.

When you turn on Location History, you may see a number of benefits across Google products and services, including personalized maps, recommendations based on places you’ve visited, help finding your phone, real-time traffic updates about your commute, and more useful ads.

Location History is turned off by default for your Google Account and can only be turned on if you opt in. 
You can pause Location History at any time in your Google Account's Activity controls.
You control what’s saved in your Location History. You can view the places where you’ve been in Google Maps Timeline, which you can edit or use to delete your Location History.


Important: Some of these steps work only on Android 8.0 and up. Learn how to check your Android version.

Turn Location History on or off
You can turn off Location History for your account at any time. If you use a work or school account, your administrator needs to make this setting available for you. If they do, you'll be able to use Location History as any other user.

Go to the "Location History" section of your Google Account.
Choose whether your account or your devices can report Location History to Google.
    
Your account and all devices: At the top, turn Location History on or off.
Only a certain device: Under "This device" or "Devices on this account," turn the device on or off.




When Location History is on

Google only receives Location History for each device where you are signed in and you have Location Reporting turned on.
    

You can change the Location Reporting setting for each device where you're signed in, and limit which devices provide location data to be included in Location History. If you want to change your Location History settings, you can choose to:
    
Report your location from only some of your devices, but not others.
Report your location from all your devices.
Turn off Location History for your Google Account. Your location won't be reported from any of your devices and you will not have new Location History recorded to your account.


Your settings for other location services on your device, like Google Location Services, Location Sharing, and Find My Device, aren't changed.

When Location History is off

Your device's locations will not be automatically saved to your Location History.
Previous activity is not deleted from your Location History. You can manually delete your Location History.
Your settings for other location services on your device, like Google Location Services, Location Sharing, and Find My Device, aren't changed.
Some location data may continue to be saved in other settings, like Web & App Activity, as part of your use of other services, like Search and Maps, even after you turn off Location History.


Delete Location History
You can manage and delete your Location History information with Google Maps Timeline. You can choose to delete all of your history, or only parts of it.
