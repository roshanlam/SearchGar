Ads in Kids apps
Ads are expected to be consistent with the maturity rating of the app or game. Ad serving can change over time so you should check what types of ads are being shown from time to time.
If you see ads that aren't appropriate for the age group the app was designed for, report the ad to Google.

Use parental controls to restrict mature content
If you share your Android phone or tablet with others, including kids, you can turn on parental controls to block downloads or purchases of content based on the content maturity level. You can choose different parental control settings for each type of content, and for each device.
Learn more about setting up parental controls.

Prevent accidental purchases with password protection 
To help prevent accidental or unwanted purchases on your device, authentication is required before any purchases, including in-app purchases, are made from any apps available in the Kids section, even if you don’t usually require one.
Learn more about passwords and authentication.
Use Google Play Family Library
