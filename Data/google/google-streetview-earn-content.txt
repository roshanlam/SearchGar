        What is Street View?
      



          Street View, by Google Maps, is a virtual representation of our surroundings on Google Maps, consisting of millions of panoramic images. Street Viewâs content comes from two sources - Google and contributors. Through our collective efforts, we enable people everywhere to virtually explore the world.

                        Study Details
                      
An online survey was conducted with consumers who had searched online for a restaurant or hotel within the previous 30 days (using any device).A total sample of 1201 respondents was
collected between July 21st and August 2nd, 2015.Different versions of a local business listing (one for a hotel, the other for a restaurant) were created to include basic info, photos and/or a virtual tour (the same media were used to create each version).  Respondents were asked to view one of the different versions for each business (in a randomized order). Each respondent viewed:  1 hotel listing + 1 restaurant listing; and  1 listing with a virtual tour + 1 listing without a virtual tour.   Note: Presentation of alternate listings were randomized evenly and consistently throughout the field.After viewing each listing, respondents were instructed to rate their interest in booking a reservation.Ratings for alternate listings (with a tour versus without) were aggregated to understand the impact of virtual tours on interest in the featured business.
