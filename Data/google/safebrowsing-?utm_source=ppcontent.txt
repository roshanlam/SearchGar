                Safety First
              

                Keeping over four billion devices safer.
              

                Google Safe Browsing helps protect over four billion devices every day by showing
                warnings to users when they attempt to navigate to dangerous sites or download
                dangerous files. Safe Browsing also notifies webmasters when their websites are
                compromised by malicious actors and helps them diagnose and resolve the problem so
                that their visitors stay safer. Safe Browsing protections work across Google
                products and power safer browsing experiences across the Internet.
              

                Our Transparency Report includes details on the threats that Safe Browsing
                identifies. The Transparency Report includes our Site
                Status diagnostic tool that you can use to see whether a site currently
                contains content that Safe Browsing has determined to be dangerous.
              














                Product Protection
              

                Safe Browsing protects Google and other products.
              














                        Chrome and Other Browsers
                      

                        Chrome and other browsers use Safe Browsing to show users a warning message
                        before they visit a dangerous site or download a harmful app. Our scanning
                        infrastructure also protects the Chrome Web Store from potentially harmful
                        extensions. Learn more









                        Search
                      

                        Users see a Safe Browsing message in Search results when Safe Browsing has
                        found that the site theyâre about to visit might be dangerous. Learn more









                        Gmail
                      

                        Safe Browsing protects Gmail users by identifying dangerous links in email
                        messages and showing warnings if users click on them. Learn more











                        Android
                      

                        Google and Android security teams collaborated to develop an app scanning
                        infrastructure that protects Google Play and powers Verify Apps to protect
                        users who install apps from outside Google Play. Safe Browsing also
                        protects Chrome users on Android by showing them warnings before they visit
                        dangerous sites. Learn more









                        Ads
                      

                        Googleâs Ads Security team uses Safe Browsing to make sure that Google ads
                        do not promote dangerous pages. Learn more














                Beginnings
              

                A history of safety
              

                Safe Browsing launched in 2007 to protect users across the web from phishing
                attacks, and has evolved to give users tools to help protect themselves from
                web-based threats like malware, unwanted software, and social engineering across
                desktop and mobile platforms.
              

                Our Safe Browsing engineering, product, and operations teams work at the forefront
                of security research and technology to build systems that help users protect
                themselves from harm. Check out our Research and the
                Google Security Blog
                for updates on Safe Browsing and other Google security technology.

                Protection for all
              

                To make the Internet safer for everyone, weâve made Safe Browsing services free and
                publicly available for developers and other companies to use in their applications
                and browsers. Today, half the worldâs online population is protected by Safe
                Browsing. If you are a developer and would like to protect your users from online
                threats, get started by visiting our API
                Documentation. If you are a webmaster, you can sign up for
                Google Search Console to receive notifications and help with security issues.

                Policies
              

                Safe Browsing gives users the ability to protect themselves from multiple types of
                unsafe sites and applications. Our policies help define the types of web threats
                about which Safe Browsing will notify users and webmasters.
              










                    Malware
                  

                    Since 2006, Safe Browsing has warned users when they attempt to navigate to
                    sites that might be malicious. Malware is software specifically designed to
                    harm a device, the software it's running, or its users.

                    Unwanted Software
                  

                    In 2014, we added protection against a broad category of harmful technology
                    that we now call âUnwanted Softwareâ: for example, programs disguised as
                    helpful downloads that actually make unexpected changes to your computer like
                    switching your homepage or other browser settings to ones you donât want.

                    Social Engineering
                  

                    Since 2005, Safe Browsing has protected users across the web from Social
                    Engineering attacks. A Social Engineering attack tricks users into performing
                    an action that they normally would not if they knew the true identity of the
                    attacker. A common example is Phishing, where a page tries to steal a user's
                    password or other personal data.
