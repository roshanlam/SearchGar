Privacy Notice for Google Accounts and Profiles Managed with Family Link, for Children under 13 (or applicable age in your country) (âPrivacy Noticeâ)




For your child to have their own Google Account or profile, we may need your permission to collect, use or disclose your childâs information as described in this Privacy Notice and the Google Privacy Policy. When you allow your child to use our services, you and your child are trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. You can choose whether your child can manage their activity controls for things like Web & App Activity and YouTube History.
This Privacy Notice for Google Accounts and Profiles Managed with Family Link, for Children under 13 (or applicable age in your country) and the Google Privacy Policy explain Googleâs privacy practices. To the extent there are privacy practices specific to your childâs account or profile, such as with respect to limitations on personalized advertising, those differences are outlined in this Privacy Notice.

This Privacy Notice does not apply to the practices of any third party (non-Google) apps, actions or websites that your child may use. You should review the applicable terms and policies for third party apps, actions, and sites to determine their appropriateness for your child, including their data collection and use practices.





Information We Collect
Once you grant permission for your child to have a Google Account or profile, their account or profile will generally be treated like your own with respect to the information that we collect. For example, we collect:

                  Information you and your child create or provide to us.
                

                    As part of the account or profile creation process, we may ask for personal information like first and last name, email address, and birthdate. We collect the information you or your child provide, such as your online contact details, which are necessary for us to contact you to request consent. We also collect the information your child creates, uploads, or receives from others when using their account or profile, such as when your child saves a picture in Google Photos or creates a document in Google Drive.
                  

                  Information we get from your childâs use of our services.
                

                    We automatically collect and store certain information about the services your child uses and how your child uses them, like when your child enters a query in Google Search, talks to the Google Assistant, or watches a video on YouTube Kids. This information includes:
                  


Your childâs apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices your child uses to access Google services, including unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your childâs apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your childâs request. For example, we collect this information when a Google service on your childâs device contacts our servers, like when they install an app from the Play Store.


Your childâs activity
We collect information about your childâs activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend apps they might like on Google Play. You can choose whether your child can manage their activity controls. Your childâs activity information that we collect may include things like search terms, videos they watch, voice and audio information when they use audio features, people with whom they communicate or share content, and Chrome browsing history theyâve synced with their Google Account. If your child uses our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, for example by using Google Meet or Duo, we may collect telephony log information. Your child can visit their Google Account to find and manage activity information thatâs saved in their account or profile and you can also help manage their activity information by signing in to your childâs Google Account, or accessing their profile in Family Link.


Your childâs location information
We collect information about your childâs location when they use our services. Your childâs location can be determined by using GPS, IP address, sensor data from their device, and information about things near their device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices. The types of location data we collect depends in part on your settings and your childâs devices.


Your childâs voice & audio information
We may collect your childâs voice and audio information. For example, if your child uses audio activation commands (e.g., âOK, Googleâ or touching the microphone icon), a recording of the following speech/audio, plus a few seconds before, may be stored to their account from any of your childâs signed-in devices, when the Web & App Activity setting is enabled.



                    We use various technologies to collect and store your childâs information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs. We do not require your child to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary to use the Google products and services available for these accounts or profiles.
                  




How We Use Information We Collect
Googleâs Privacy Policy explains in greater detail how we may use the data Google collects in association with your childâs Google Account or profile. In general, we use your childâs information: to provide, maintain, and improve our services; to develop new services; to customize our services for your child; to measure performance and understand how our services are used; to communicate directly with your child in relation to our services; and to help improve the safety and reliability of our services.
We use different technologies to process your childâs information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your childâs content to provide them with things like customized search results or other features tailored to how they use our services. And we analyze your childâs content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable their account or profile or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
We may use your childâs information to provide recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, depending on your childâs settings, Google Play may use information like apps your child has installed to suggest new apps they might like.
In addition, we may combine the information we collect among our services and across your childâs devices for the purposes described above. Depending on your childâs account or profile settings, their activity on other sites and apps may be associated with their personal information in order to improve Googleâs services.
Google will not serve personalized ads to your child, which means ads will not be based on information from your childâs account or profile. Instead, ads may be based on information like the content of the website or app your child is viewing, the current search query, or general location (such as city or state). When browsing the web or using non-Google apps, your child may encounter ads served by other (non-Google) ad providers, including ads personalized by third parties.




Information Your Child Can Share
Your child may be able to share information, including photos, videos, audio, and location, publicly and with others, when signed in with their Google account or profile. When your child shares information publicly, it may be accessible through search engines like Google Search.




Information Google Shares
Information we collect may be shared outside of Google in limited circumstances. We do not share personal information with companies, organizations, and individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:

                  With consent
                

                    We will share personal information outside of Google with consent (as applicable).
                  

                  With your family group
                

                    Your childâs information, including their name, photo, email address, and Play purchases, may be shared with members of your family group on Google.
                  

                  For external processing
                

                    We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Notice, the Google Privacy Policy, and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
                  

                  For legal reasons
                

                    We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
                  


meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;


enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations;


detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or


protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.



                    We may also share non-personally identifiable information (such as trends about the general use of our services) publicly and with our partners â like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from browsers or devices for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
                  




Access to Your Childâs Personal Information
If your child has a Google Account, you can access, update, remove, export, and restrict the processing of your childâs information by signing into their Google Account. If you do not remember your childâs password, you can reset it through the Family Link app or Family Link settings on the web. Once signed in, you can use the various controls described in the Google Privacy Policy, such as Google activity controls, to help manage your childâs privacy settings and information.
If your child has a profile, you can access, update, remove, export, and restrict the processing of your childâs information through the Family Link app or Family Link settings on the web.
Your child will have the ability to delete their past activity in âMy Activity,â and by default grant app permissions (including things like device location, microphone, or contacts) to third parties. You can also use Family Link to edit or modify your childâs Google Account or profile information, review app activity and app permissions, and manage your childâs ability to grant certain permissions to apps or third party services to access your childâs information.
If at any time you wish to stop further collection or use of your child's information, you can delete your childâs Google Account or profile by clicking âDelete accountâ or âDelete profileâ on your childâs Account or Profile Info page in the Family Link app or Family Link settings on the web. Your childâs account or profile information will be permanently deleted within a reasonable period of time.
