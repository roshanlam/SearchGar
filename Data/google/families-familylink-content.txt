Not all screen time is the same. Help your child make healthy decisions about what they do on their device, with activity reports showing how much time theyâre spending on their favorite apps.â 


Manage their apps
Handy notifications let you approve or block apps your child wants to download from the Google Play Store. You can also manage in-app purchases, and hide specific apps on their device.
