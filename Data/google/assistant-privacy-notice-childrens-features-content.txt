Privacy Notice for Audio Collection from Childrenâs Features on Google Assistant
We want to help parents understand how we collect voice and audio information 
when people engage with childrenâs features, like Assistant for Families 
Actions or YouTube Kids videos, through Google Assistant. In addition to the 
information provided in the 
Google Privacy Policy this Privacy Notice also 
applies to the use of these features on Google Assistant. 
Children under the 
applicable age in their country 
whose parents have created their 
Google Account with Family Link can link their 
accounts to most Google Assistant-enabled devices. 
The "Include voice and audio activity" option under the Web & App Activity 
setting controls whether voice and audio recordings are stored to your Google 
Account when you use your voice to interact with Assistant. This option is off 
by default when creating a Google account, and is not required to use the 
Assistant. 
If your childâs "Include voice and audio activity" option under the Web & App 
Activity setting is checked, when they interact with the Assistant on a signed-in
device, a recording of their interaction, plus a few seconds before, may be 
stored with their account. Google uses this saved voice and audio activity to 
develop and improve its audio recognition technologies and the Google services 
that use them, like Google Assistant. If your child uses Google Assistant with 
Voice Match and youâve turned on this voice and audio activity setting, Google 
may also temporarily process a model of your childâs voice from their saved 
audio to develop and improve Googleâs voice technologies and Google services 
that use them. 
If you created a new account for your child with Family Link, you can 

access, update, remove and export your childâs audio recordings by signing into their Google Account. 
If you do not remember your childâs password, you can reset it through the 
Family Link app or via 
Family Link settings on the web. Once signed in, 
you can use the various controls described in the Google Privacy Policy (such 
as 
Google activity controls) to manage your childâs voice and 
audio activity settings and the audio recordings stored with their account, 
including to delete any activity stored in their account. 
If your child created their own account prior to the change of the minimum 
required age in your country, and you later granted permission for your child 
to keep their account, you may need your childâs permission to reset their 
password or sign in to their account. 
If you have consented to enable Voice Match for your child so that Google 
Assistant can recognize them and tell them apart from others, audio from a 
small number of your childâs Assistant interactions may be saved on their 
Assistant-enabled devices and sent temporarily to Googleâs servers to fine tune 
your childâs Voice Match model. 
If you interact with childrenâs featuresâlike Assistant for Families Actions or 
YouTube Kids videosâon Google Assistant without a Google Account Managed with 
Family Link that has opted in to include audio recordings or consented to Voice 
Match, we will only briefly collect voice and audio recordings of those 
interactions. This information is processed to allow for use of the audio 
feature, so we can fulfill the interaction, and then immediately deleted from 
our servers.
