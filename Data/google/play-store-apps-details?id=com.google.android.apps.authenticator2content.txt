Unfortunately, it's gone now and there isn't an option to use it. As another user responded, there wasn't a way to turn it off, well, there is no way to turn it on. Google could've at least given the option to use it, with the default of it being off.7 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAdam Lynchmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJuly 20, 2022Used to be fine. Tapping to uncover codes is super inconvenient if you have more than one application to choose from. Additionally, I opened my app three times just now and each time it acted like it was my first time opening the app - all my accounts were gone. For whatever reason opening the app through the app store worked, but I should never have stability issues using the app on a Google phone, for Pete's sake. EDIT: doesn't look like I have to tap codes now. Thank you!61 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoTWmore_vert Flag inappropriateJuly 20, 2022I like the new Tap to Reveal feature. It hides codes which aren't needed at the time. And is more secure when out in crowded places. Please bring it back (possibly as an option for users to chose) while maintaining decent performance. Sounds like a lot of people complained that the feature was slowing down the app.9 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new* Added device encryption to storage of secret values.flagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacySimilar appsarrow_forwardOneSpan Mobile AuthenticatorOneSpan France SAS3.9starMicrosoft AuthenticatorMicrosoft Corporation4.6starStarling 2FAAuthy3.4starDuo MobileDuo Security LLC3.4starAegis Authenticator - 2FA AppBeem Development4.5starandOTP - Android OTP AuthenticatorJakob Nixdorf4.3starMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle ChatGoogle LLC2.5starGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.1starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube KidsGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
