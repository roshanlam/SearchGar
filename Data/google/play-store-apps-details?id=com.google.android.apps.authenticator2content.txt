Your codes now require an additional step to reveal them as well, slowing down every log in process considerably, especially when youre needed to use the app multiple times a day. It used to be a smooth experience, but now it adds a needless speed bump to your work day. I'll be looking into other 2FA apps soon.10 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGreg Aliotomore_vert Flag inappropriateMay 26, 2022I hate the new Click To Reveal PIN feature. Huge time waste, terribly inconvenient. Google Authenticator was simple and easy to use before, and it was perfect the way it was. We could just open it up, scroll to the right entry, make sure the timer isn't about to run out, and get the code you need. "Click to reveal PIN" is just extra steps that do nothing but waste time and take extra taps. Please give us an option to disable the "Click to reveal PIN"141 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoChris Powermore_vert Flag inappropriateJune 1, 2022I love the latest update's "tap to reveal PIN." From a security perspective, this is a great and simple feature. This update *should* have reduced the background processing required to open the app, making things faster. Unfortunately the opposite is true; the app now takes over ten seconds just to open before *anything* is displayed. I'm hoping this is just a temporary bug and I will be able to update this review soon.29 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new* Added the ability to transfer accounts to a different device, e.g. when switching phones* Refreshed the look and feel of the appflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacyMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC3.9starGoogle ChatGoogle LLC4.0starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle Find My DeviceGoogle LLC4.4starSimilar appsarrow_forwardOneSpan Mobile AuthenticatorOneSpan France SAS3.8starMobile Authenticator ESOneSpan France SAS2.8starMicrosoft AuthenticatorMicrosoft Corporation4.6starLastPass AuthenticatorGoTo Technologies USA, Inc.4.7starPinki VOIPTunnelGuru4.4starAegis Authenticator - 2FA AppBeem Development4.4starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
