That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.Google Fit will also help you:TRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCHGet instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.MONITOR YOUR GOALSSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal.

Always. I can go to the park and walk 9 miles on a measured path and the watch shows 9 miles. Then when it later syncs to the phone, it drops down to 7.55 miles. It then pushes that incorrect info back to the watch. Please fix this! TicWatch Pro 3 and Pixel 6 Pro. Update to their response. It isn't a time thing. Hours and days later it still shows wrong. It isn't reinstalling the app. I've done that entirely. Repeatedly. It's just bugged.44 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCJuly 15, 2022Hi there, it may take time for your devices to update your data. We’d suggest checking if you’re using the same account on your devices then see if you’ll get the same result. Also, reinstalling your app might help. Check this out: https://bit.ly/3GWsW4lSaad Gondalmore_vert Flag inappropriateJuly 13, 2022Watch data will not sync with phone app. Bluetooth is on, watch and phone are connected. Double checked my account on both devices and they are the same. I manually tried syncing from the journal page and still nothing. The only thing that seems to work is uninstalling/reinstalling the app and restarting the phone.31 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCJuly 14, 2022Hey Saad, we're sorry you've had this experience. Try clearing the cache of the Google Fit app. If the activity numbers are different on your watch and phone, move the devices closer together so they can sync: https://bit.ly/3oYR4xfAndrew Davidsonmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJuly 10, 2022Gps has me swimming across the Hudson Lately it hasn't been working as well, missing hours of hiking. And when it does track me, I can see on the map that it's jumping me all over the place which realistically wouldn't make sense - like walking along the Hudson in NYC and having me swim across like 3 times. Itd be fine if I could correct the map to be more accurate but you can't. Overall pretty poor for a Google product.27 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCJuly 10, 2022We'll take this as feedback, Andrew. You can try turning off and on all permissions for automatic tracking on your Google Fit app after restarting your phone. This helps calculate distance and create a map of your activity in your Google Fit journal.
