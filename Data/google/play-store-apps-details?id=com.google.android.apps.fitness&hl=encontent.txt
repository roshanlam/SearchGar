That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.Google Fit will also help you:TRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCHGet instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.MONITOR YOUR GOALSSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal.

No longer synching with my fitness devices regardless of all troubleshooting done. This is a known issue for many and Google has failed to correct it. Kinda pointless without being able to synch. Says it can't display devices. Honestly, don't waste your time till this known issue is actually corrected. *** As for the " response and suggestion to uninstall and reinstall" I have done that multiple times as well as disconnect and reconnect all devices. Didn't help144 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCMay 25, 2022Hi Christine, for a better Google Fit app experience, try reinstalling it and rebooting all your devices after. Also, make sure the location services and activity tracking permissions are both enabled.

I was tracking a run, and the app was giving accurate distance and time call outs, but upon finishing the run, the recorded times and distances are off by almost 2 miles. I have the settings set to allow use of GPS at all times, but it always seems to think I am Jesus and can run accross lakes and ponds.32 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCMay 31, 2022We appreciate your review, Drew. For best results, try reinstalling your Google Fit app then try rebooting your phone after. Also, make sure your phone is running on its latest OS version and is connected to a stable network.

I'm just want the app to track when I have the phone on me. I'm not connected to anything just trying to use the app. I've uninstalled/installed the app several times & rebooted my phone. My GPS is on at all times & activities metrics set to be ON. It just doesn't want to track sometimes.1 person found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCJune 4, 2022We hear you and we'll take this as feedback.
