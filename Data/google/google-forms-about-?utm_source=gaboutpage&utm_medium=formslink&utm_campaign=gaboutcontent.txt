See what you can do with Google Forms 











                    Create an online form as easily as creating a document
                  


                      Select from multiple question types, drag-and-drop to reorder questions, and customize values as easily as pasting a list.
                    




   








                    Send polished surveys and forms
                  


                      Customize colors, images, and fonts to adjust the look and feel or reflect your organizationâs branding. And add custom logic that shows questions based on answers, for a more seamless experience.
                    




   







                    Analyze responses with automatic summaries
                  


                      See charts with response data update in real-time. Or open the raw data with Google Sheets for deeper analysis or automation.
                    




   






                    Create and respond to surveys from anywhere
                  


                      Access, create, and edit forms on-the-go, from screens big and small. Others can respond to your survey from wherever they areâfrom any mobile device, tablet, or computer.
                    




   










                  Build forms and analyze results together
                

                  Add collaboratorsâjust like with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slidesâto build questions together in real-time. Then analyze results together without having to share multiple versions of the file.
                




                  Work with clean response data
                

                  Use built-in intelligence to set response validation rules. For example, ensure that email addresses are properly formatted or that numbers fall within a specified range.
                




                  Share forms via email, link, or website
                

                  It's easy to share forms with specific people or with a broad audience by embedding forms on your website or sharing the links on social media.
                








              Security, compliance, and privacy
            

   






                      Secure by default
                    

                      We use industry-leading security measures to keep your data safe, including advanced malware protections. Forms is also cloud-native, eliminating the need for local files and minimizing risk to your devices.
                    



                      Encryption in transit and at rest
                    

                      All files uploaded to Google Drive or created in Forms are encrypted in transit and at rest.
                    



                      Compliance to support regulatory requirements
                    

                      Our products, including Forms, regularly undergo independent verification of their security, privacy, and compliance controls.
                    




                    Private by design
                  

                    Forms adheres to the same robust privacy commitments and data protections as the rest of Google Cloudâs enterprise services.
                  


                      You control your data.
                    


                      We never use your Forms content for ad purposes.
                    


                      We never sell your personal information to third parties.
