What information is shared with Google
If you turn on usage and diagnostics, your device sends info to Google about what’s working and not working. For example, your device can send info like:

Battery level
How often you use your apps
Quality and length of your network connections (like mobile, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth)


Turn usage & diagnostics on or off
Important: If you turn off usage and diagnostics, your device can still get essential services, like a new version of Android. Turning off usage and diagnostics won’t affect info that apps might collect.
To choose whether to send usage and diagnostics info to Google:

Open your device's Settings app.
Tap Google  More   Usage & diagnostics.
Turn Usage & diagnostics on or off.


Tip: If you use a shared device, other user profiles may change this setting.
How Google uses this information
Google uses usage and diagnostics info to improve products and services, like Google apps and Android devices. All info is used in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy.
For example, Google can use usage and diagnostics info to improve:

Battery life: Google can use info about what's using the most battery on your device to help make common features use less battery.
Crashing or freezing on devices: Google can use info about when apps crash and freeze on your device to help make the Android operating system more reliable.

Some aggregated info can help partners, like Android developers, make their apps and products better, too.
