I get network issues all the time, not because of my network that works for everything else, JUST this app. Some downloads freeze halfway, no matter how many times I restart, and other times I get a image of a sad satellite saying Try Again. I also have "auto update" turned on but every time I check there's like 20+ apps waiting to update. It's also just a bad, confusing interface. Come on Google, get your act together!!!4,934 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAddison Cartermore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyFebruary 3, 2022Oh my goodness, no words can describe how awesome and incredible this game is. First off, the detail on this game is beyond good, also the story line is so suspenseful and crazy good. The only issues about this game is probably the lack of ads. I just recommend the developers, or the people that made this game could please shorten the ads, cause it does get annoying, but other than that, it's amazing. Also, the fact that it's free is shocking to me, the point is I highly recommend this game! :)4,583 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoCurtis O'Dellmore_vert Flag inappropriateJanuary 15, 2022Best Ever!!! Only thing I would change are the prices. Some games are great in the paid section, but most are either a waste of time or just glitch ridden and full of ads. Nobody wants to stop playing every 30 seconds to watch an ad for another game thats filled with issues as well! Other than that Google is the best place to find what u need and the correct information.
