I love getting into a game and it saves my progress! The only thing that annoys me is that sometimes when I get into a new game, it'll do this weird thing to sign into Google Play Games. It will grey out the screen a bit and then the black bar will come down like a squeegee and go down the screen to remove the tint. I don't know what that is. ✌1,436 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSashamore_vert Flag inappropriateMarch 21, 2022For being a core android app, this app is complete garbage! I get network issues all the time, not because of my network that works for everything else, JUST this app. Some downloads freeze halfway, no matter how many times I restart, and other times I get a image of a sad satellite saying Try Again. I also have "auto update" turned on but every time I check there's like 20+ apps waiting to update. It's also just a bad, confusing interface. Come on Google, get your act together!!!5,440 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoPaul Dailymore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJune 7, 2022Meh, I like the free solitaire, however it would be great if it would stay muted. I click "hard" and then have .5 seconds to click mute before it blasts out my speakers. Also snake is broken entirely. The balls and things to get work, but visually the field is blank for me. Possibly the background is drawn on top of everything.516 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacySimilar appsarrow_forwardPlay Services Info (Update)weberdo4.2starQR Code ReaderAxiomatic Inc.4.2starGame Booster: Game LauncherBGNmobi4.5starWeather - By XiaomiXiaomi Inc.4.5starWeatherMacroPinch4.5starDraw.ly: Color by NumberHappy coloring4.4starMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle ChatGoogle LLC2.5starGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.1starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube KidsGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English)
