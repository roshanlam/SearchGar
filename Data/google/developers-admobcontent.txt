 Google AdMob is a mobile advertising platform that you can use to generate revenue from your app.
Key capabilities
 
Earn more from AdMob's in-app ads


      Show ads from millions of Google advertisers in real time, or use
      AdMob Mediation to earn from over 40 premium networks through the
      AdMob platform to simplify your ad operations, improve
      competition, and earn more.
    

      AdMob mediation has
      ad network
      optimization built in, which automatically adjusts the
      positions of your other ad networks in your mediation stack to
      ensure you maximize your revenue.
    

 
Improve user experience

    Native and video ads create a positive user experience as you
    monetize by matching the look and feel of your app. Choose from
    different ad templates, customize them, and experiment with
    different layouts on the fly without republishing your app.
  
 
Scale fast


      When your app's a global or domestic hit, you can monetize users
      quickly with AdMob, by showing ads to users in more than 200
      markets.
    

      More than one app? AdMob house ads is a free tool that enables you
      to cross-promote your apps to your userbase, across your family of
      apps.
    


Access monetization reports

    AdMob is the premier monetization platform for mobile. While
    generating ad revenue, AdMob also produces its own monetization
    reports that you can use to make smarter decisions about product
    strategy.
  
 
How does it work?
 AdMob helps you monetize your mobile app through in-app advertising. Ads can be displayed in a number of formats and are seamlessly added to platform native UI components. 
Before you can display ads within your app, you'll need to create an AdMob account and activate one or more ad unit IDs. This is a unique identifier for the places in your app where ads are displayed.
AdMob uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK which helps app developers gain insights about their users and maximize ad revenue. To do so, the default integration of the Mobile Ads SDK collects information such as device information.
