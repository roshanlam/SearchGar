            2 million people have chosen AdSense, here's why
          




                Earn money from your site
              

                Millions of advertisers compete for your ad space. That means more money, more relevant ads, and more ad spaces filled.
              




                Ads optimized for mobile
              

                Google can optimize the size of your ad units to automatically fit desktop or mobile, meaning there's more chance they'll be seen and clicked.
              




                Save time
              

                Add one piece of code to your site and Google will automatically show ads tailored to your site's layout, saving you time making changes to ad code.
