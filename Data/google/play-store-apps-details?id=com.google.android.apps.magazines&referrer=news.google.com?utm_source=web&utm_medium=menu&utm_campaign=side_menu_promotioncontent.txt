Works fine again. Thanks Google! Today's (June 6, 2022) update has rendered the app useless. It crashes instantly upon opening and says: "Unfortunately, Google News stopped." And it continues to run and crash in the background. Needs fixed. Good app until this. Will update review when fixed.94 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCJuly 7, 2022Hi John.

With the latest update, Google News App should now be working as usual.Nicholas Vogelmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJuly 8, 2022App won't even start after the 6 July update. Android just says the app has a big and won't open. Cleared cache, cleared data, uninstalled and reinstalled, still nada. I have no idea what's going on. EDIT: I want to leave the original review for the fact that the Google team responded insanely fast and I've redownloaded the app and everything works as expected. Thank you sincerely to the Devs. I'm not a Dev but I work with them so I know it's difficult to respond to user bugs. Y'all Rock!65 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCJuly 7, 2022Hi Nicholas.

It functions well and I can honestly say I've never experienced a crash. However, the best articles, from the major sources, always seem to be limited in their free reading. This makes zero sense as you can look up the article on the web for free at any time after you've reached your limit on Google News. I would much rather have a set monthly charge from Google News and allow totally free reading. It gets extremely frustrating to go back and forth.277 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new· Bug fixes and performance improvementsflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacySimilar appsarrow_forwardNewsBreak: Local News & AlertsParticle Media Inc.4.4starFast News - breaking newsPinenuts Android Developers4.2starNews Suite by SonySony Network Communications Inc.3.9starDaily Mail OnlineDaily Mail Online4.6starUSA TODAYUSA TODAY3.7starNPR NewsNPR3.6starMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle ChatGoogle LLC2.5starGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.1starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube KidsGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
