For some reason I can never 'see fewer articles' regarding gun violence and shootings or Top stories. It's strange that these are delivered to me on my daily briefing, yet I never asked or looked or followed anything remotely close to that garbage. Developer, please allow us to absolutely block articles with certain keywords that we set. This is a must have feature. Thank you.16 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCJune 3, 2022Hi Jacob Sorry to hear you're experiencing issues. Please create a post in our Google News Forum for our community of experts to assist: https://goo.gle/2KJcIk5. Appreciate it!Anita Chanmore_vert Flag inappropriateMay 16, 2022I've used this for a while and its a great easy way for me to read up on some news almost everyday. Recently many random Chinese articles have showed up and I repeatedly removed them either by choosing don't show content on the topic, source, or in Chinese but the next day more will show up. There are no signs of my account being hacked and I don't understand why it seems like the feedback isnt working.115 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSlyMisanthropemore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyMay 1, 2022Constantly shows articles related to subjects I have no interest in despite my preference selections and constantly hiding or blocking articles, subjects, and sources. Now the option to "see less stories like this" is totally gone and I am blocking major news sources, and still I am shown things I know I have told the app not to show. The options to edit the news feed are symbolic and worthless. If you truly want to tailor a news feed I presume there are better options.165 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new· Bug fixes and performance improvementsflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacyMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC3.9starGoogle ChatGoogle LLC4.0starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle Find My DeviceGoogle LLC4.4starSimilar appsarrow_forwardFast News - breaking newsPinenuts Android Developers4.2starmyMail: app for Gmail&OutlookMGL MY.COM (CYPRUS) LIMITED4.3starEmail Aqua Mail - Fast, SecureAqua Mail4.4starNews in Levels: Learn EnglishNews in Levels4.7starCNN Breaking US & World NewsCNN4.6starWION News - World News LiveINDIADOTCOM DIGITAL PRIVATE LIMITED4.8starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
