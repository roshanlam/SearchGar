As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our servicesWhat we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our servicesContent in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or othersIn case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these termsUnderstanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy.

For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.Develop, improve, and update Google servicesWe’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.

However, for legal purposes, we offer our services without warranties unless explicitly stated in our service-specific additional terms. The law requires that we explain this using specific legal language and that we use capital letters to help make sure you see it, as follows:TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE PROVIDE OUR SERVICES “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY WARRANTIES ABOUT THE CONTENT OR FEATURES OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THEIR ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.LiabilitiesFor all usersBoth the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law allows us to limit certain liabilities — but not others — under these terms.These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct.To the extent allowed by applicable law:Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional termsGoogle isn’t liable for:loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savingsindirect or consequential lossespunitive damagesGoogle’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) $200 or (2) the fees paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the disputeFor business users and organizations onlyIf you’re a business user or organization:To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.Taking action in case of problemsBefore taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless doing so would:cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Googleviolate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s ordercompromise an investigationcompromise the operation, integrity, or security of our servicesRemoving your contentIf any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.Suspending or terminating your access to Google servicesGoogle reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policieswe’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court orderyour conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to youFor more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page. If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.Settling disputes, governing law, and courtsFor information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.About these termsBy law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.
