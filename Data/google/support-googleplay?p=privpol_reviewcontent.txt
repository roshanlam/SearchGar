When you can write reviews in the Play Store

You can only review apps and games you’ve downloaded.
You can’t leave a review from an enterprise account, like an account for work or school.
If any account on your device is part of a beta program for an app, you can’t leave a review for that app.
You can leave a beta program if you want to write a review.
