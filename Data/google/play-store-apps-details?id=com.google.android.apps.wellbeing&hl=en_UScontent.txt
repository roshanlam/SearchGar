It stoped my internet access, my access to the tablet settings couldn't get past the initial selection menu, every program bogged down, then the power off or restart put the tablet into an endless loading screen. It's causing harm! UNINSTALL!!!!!!712 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoJoseph Tanmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 14, 2022I really like many things about this app and having my screen turn to greyscale is a great reminder to put them phone away. BUT, the greyscale and DnD turn off before the set time, so I'm often disturbed by notifications in the middle of the night or if I look at the screen if I wake up at night it's super bright and in color. This has persisted through many system and app updates, but I don't find any other complaints about this online. Is this just Google/Pixel6 being buggy? Super annoying....427 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMike Usnikmore_vert Flag inappropriateJuly 20, 2022Garbage pre-installed app. Can't uninstall in. It messes up all other apps including alarms if you use your phone as an alarm clock. Since automaticly installed it causes the phone to get hot, battery to rapidly drain, and will lock up your phone when using other apps or answering calls. Habe not installed a new app in the last 6 months and never had a problem with the phone. This installed in the update and have had nothing but problems since.30 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's newWind Down is now Bedtime mode and has the following new features:• Turn on Bedtime mode automatically with a daily schedule or while your phone is charging at bedtime• Pause Bedtime mode if you need more time before bed• Turn Bedtime mode on or off with a single tap from Quick SettingsflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacySimilar appsarrow_forwardSamsung Push ServiceSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.3.9starWeather - By XiaomiXiaomi Inc.4.5starVerisureSecuritas Direct4.0starMy VerisureSecuritas Direct - Verisure4.0starPlay Services Info (Update)weberdo4.2starQR Code Generator & QR MakerQR Scanner & QR Code Generator & Radio & Notes4.7starMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle ChatGoogle LLC2.5starGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.1starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube KidsGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
