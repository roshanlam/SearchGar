It stoped my internet access, my access to the tablet settings couldn't get past the initial selection menu, every program bogged down, then the power off or restart put the tablet into an endless loading screen. It's causing harm! UNINSTALL!!!!!!279 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoJoseph Tanmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 14, 2022I really like many things about this app and having my screen turn to greyscale is a great reminder to put them phone away. BUT, the greyscale and DnD turn off before the set time, so I'm often disturbed by notifications in the middle of the night or if I look at the screen if I wake up at night it's super bright and in color. This has persisted through many system and app updates, but I don't find any other complaints about this online. Is this just Google/Pixel6 being buggy? Super annoying....275 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMatthew Hallmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 20, 2022I don't want this app. It will frequently turn itself back on despite me deactivating everything I can in the settings. I can't remove it, so it will just turn back on regardless of my choices in the settings. Notifications and background data will be reactivated about once a week despite my best efforts to turn them off.350 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's newWind Down is now Bedtime mode and has the following new features:• Turn on Bedtime mode automatically with a daily schedule or while your phone is charging at bedtime• Pause Bedtime mode if you need more time before bed• Turn Bedtime mode on or off with a single tap from Quick SettingsflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacyMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC3.9starGoogle ChatGoogle LLC4.0starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle Find My DeviceGoogle LLC4.4starSimilar appsarrow_forwardSettings AppKF Software House4.0starOxygen UpdaterAdhiraj S.
