With a Google Account, you can do things like:

Send and receive email using Gmail
Find your new favorite video on YouTube
Download apps from Google Play


Step 1: Choose a Google Account type
For myself To manage a business
Important: When you create a Google Account for your business, you can turn business personalization on. A business account also makes it easier to set up Google Business Profile, which helps improve your business visibility and manage your online information.
When you create a Google Account, we ask for some personal info. By providing accurate info, you can help keep your account secure and make our services more useful.
Tip: You don't need a Gmail account to create a Google Account. You can use your non-Gmail email address to create one instead.

Go to the Google Account sign in page.
Click Create account.
Enter your name.
In the "Username" field, enter a username.
Enter and confirm your password.
    
Tip: When you enter your password on mobile, the first letter isn't case sensitive.


Click Next.
    
Optional: Add and verify a phone number for your account.


Click Next.


Use an existing email address

Go to the Google Account Sign In page.
Click Create account.
Enter your name.
Click Use my current email address instead.
Enter your current email address.
Click Next.
Verify your email address with the code sent to your existing email.
Click Verify.


Step 2: Protect your account with recovery info
If you forget your password or someone is using your account without your permission, updated recovery info makes it much more likely you’ll get your account back.

Fix issues

Check if you already have a Google Account

If you signed in to any Google product before, such as Gmail, Maps, or YouTube, you already have a Google Account. You can use the same username and password you created to sign in to any other Google products.
If you can't remember that you signed in and would like to check if you have an account, enter your email address. You'll find a message if there isn't a Google Account associated with your email address.
You can sign in to an existing Google Account.


Check where email notifications are sent

By default, account related notifications are sent to your new Gmail address, or to your non-Google email if you signed up with a different email address.
To change where you get notifications, edit your contact email.

Tip: You can also create a Google Account with a non-Google email you already own.


If the email is already used

You can't choose this email address for a new account. If this email address is yours, it's possible that:
