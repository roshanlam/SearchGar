Who is my administrator?Quick definition: A person who manages Google services or devices for a company, school, or group.

Someone in your company, school, or group
If you use Google services with a company, school, or other group, you probably have an administrator who set up your account or Chrome device. This person also manages which services you can use. Because the administrator is part of your organization, not part of Google, we can't tell you exactly who that person is. But here are ideas of who to ask.
Your administrator might be:

The person who gave you your username, as in Someone in your IT department or Help desk (at a company or school)
The person who manages your email service or web site (in a small business or club)


I'm an administrator
If you are an administrator of a work, school, or group account (for example, you signed up for a Google Workspace account), and you forgot your password, see Reset your administrator password.

account has no administrator
If the account you want help with ends in no administrator manages your account. Your account isn’t associated with a company, school, or organization. Instead, it’s a free Google Account that you can manage yourself.
For help signing in to your free gmail.com account, see Can’t sign in to Google Account.
