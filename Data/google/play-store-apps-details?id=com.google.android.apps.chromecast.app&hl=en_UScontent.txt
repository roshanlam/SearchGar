Again. The issue is I have set up my home multiple times. The latest time it lost all 5 of my speakers but not one of the chromecasts. Now I have to go and resetup everything again, but I'll have to factory reset my speakers to get home to see them on the same wireless network. And sadly it has happened twice before. The app works fine when things can be seen. I just wish they'd move profiles somewhere easier to recover. Or even provide a backup function.664 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCMay 20, 2022Hey Matt, try rebooting your Made by Google devices, phone, and router to refresh the connection. Make sure they're within 15 to 20 ft of each other.

I seem to have to redo it every six months or so, and it's a steep learning curve every time. I did end up resetting it (thank you to Dev for the suggestion, but I did that anyway) and then it was even more headscratching trying to figure out the setup steps. For it working on the end. Took 20 minutes I would rather have spent watching YouTube. (Dev, thanks for the link, I may need it again six months from now when I have to set up again.)272 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCMay 26, 2022Hey JP, try resetting your Chromecast by pressing and holding the small button for 25 seconds then set it up again. Once done, reboot your phone and router to refresh the connection.

It's a bit overwhelming though. It's not organized very well and it doesn't provide notifications or have Android home screen widgets. Passive users will have a hard time getting the most out of it without diving deep into the settings.211 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCMay 19, 2021Hi Jonathan, thanks for posting.
