Speakers connection is usually shoddy when trying to use them as a group, music cuts in and out. The lights won't respond fairly often, and some of them can't even seem to connect. Google doesn't respond my requests for assistance.291 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoEdward Tmore_vert Flag inappropriateJuly 13, 2022Decent and on the right track but could be improved. They focused on up front ease of use and it's pretty good on that front, especially after the recent design update. But sometimes I need more details about my devices and cannot see them or cannot find them. Also, there is a some lag in reporting network outages.140 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoTim Ellermore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJuly 19, 2022I've found the home app to be useful, when it works. I don't have a robust home setup, but the app inconsistently detects my Home Minis, which have their own list of glitches and frustrations. Update 7/19/2022: I've been presented with various aspects of the Home functions which would seem to be usable IF the interface were intuitive at all. "Routines" are actually something I'm interested in, yet I cannot navigate Home in order to set anything up or understand how it works. Terrible design.31 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's newOver the next few days we’ll be rolling out the following:With the Google Home app you can control and manage compatible lights, cameras, TVs, and more – all from one place.New in this update:Bug fixes and improvementsflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttps://www.google.com/intl/en_US/chrome/browser/privacy/Similar appsarrow_forwardApps for Chromecast Guidei-art4.6starSmartThingsSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.3starCast to TV - Chromecast, RokuInShot Inc.4.5starScreen Mirroring - TV MiracastStudiosoolter4.1starHome RemoteThe Home Remote LLC3.9starTV Cast Pro for Chromecast2kit consulting3.5star$4.99More by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle ChatGoogle LLC2.5starGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.1starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube KidsGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle Find My DeviceGoogle LLC4.4starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
