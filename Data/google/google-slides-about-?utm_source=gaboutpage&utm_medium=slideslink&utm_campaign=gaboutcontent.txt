See what you can do with Google Slides 











                    Make beautiful presentations, together
                  


                      Stay in sync in your slides, with easy sharing and real-time editing. Use comments and assign action items to build your ideas together.
                    




   








                    Present slideshows with confidence
                  


                      With easy-to-use presenter view, speaker notes, and live captions, Slides makes presenting your ideas a breeze. You can even present to Google Meet video calls directly from Slides.
                    




   







                    Seamlessly connect to your other Google apps
                  


                      Slides is thoughtfully connected to other Google apps you love, saving you time. Embed charts from Google Sheets or reply to comments directly from Gmail. You can even search the web and Google Drive for relevant content and images directly from Slides.
                    




   






                    Extend collaboration and intelligence to PowerPoint files
                  


                      Easily edit Microsoft PowerPoint presentations online without converting them, and layer on Slidesâ enhanced collaborative and assistive features like comments, action items, and Smart Compose.
                    




   










                  Work on fresh content
                

                  With Slides, everyoneâs working on the latest version of a presentation. And with edits automatically saved in version history, itâs easy to track or undo changes.
                




                  Make slides faster, with built-in intelligence
                

                  Assistive features like Smart Compose and autocorrect help you build slides faster with fewer errors.
                




                  Stay productive, even offline
                

                  You can access, create, and edit Slides even without an internet connection, helping you stay productive from anywhere.
                








              Security, compliance, and privacy
            

   






                      Secure by default
                    

                      We use industry-leading security measures to keep your data safe, including advanced malware protections. Slides is also cloud-native, eliminating the need for local files and minimizing risk to your devices.
                    



                      Encryption in transit and at rest
                    

                      All files uploaded to Google Drive or created in Slides are encrypted in transit and at rest.
                    



                      Compliance to support regulatory requirements
                    

                      Our products, including Slides, regularly undergo independent verification of their security, privacy, and compliance controls.
                    




                    Private by design
                  

                    Slides adheres to the same robust privacy commitments and data protections as the rest of Google Cloudâs enterprise services.
                  


                      You control your data.
                    


                      We never use your Slides content for ad purposes.
                    


                      We never sell your personal information to third parties.
