The safer way to sign in to all of your online accounts.





Across all of your online accounts, signing in is the front door to your personal information. Itâs also the primary entrypoint for risks, making it important to protect. 
We make signing into Google and all your apps and services secure by default. With built-in tools and automatic protections, such as alerts when your Google Account is being accessed from a new device, we make it quick and simple to sign in safely.












































        
        PASSWORD MANAGER
      





Strong passwords help keep you safe

Choosing strong, unique passwords for your online accounts is an important step in keeping your personal information private, but the majority of people say they use the same, weak password across multiple sites, increasing the vulnerability of those accounts.



Googleâs Password Manager helps you create strong passwords

Built into Chrome and Android, Googleâs Password Manager creates, securely saves, and fills in passwords for all of your online accounts.

Automatic Password Alerts help keep your passwords safe

Every day, new data breaches publicly expose millions of usernames and passwords. Google monitors for compromised passwords, so if any of your saved passwords have been found to be involved in a data breach, weâll automatically alert you.



Update your passwords with Google Assistant
COMING SOON

When it comes to fixing compromised passwords, speed matters. Chrome is rolling out a quick fix feature: It can flag your compromised passwords and with the help of Google Assistant, change them for you with a single tap.

        2-Step Verification
      





2-Step verification provides a second layer of sign-in security

Compromised passwords are more common than you might think. One of the best ways to protect your account is to have an extra form of verification in place. 2-Step verification helps keep out anyone who shouldnât have access to your account by requiring a second step after you enter your password.

              Turn on 2-Step verification
              






Phone-based authentication is simple and secure

Using a tangible form of authentication when signing in to your online accounts, such as your phone, is proven to be far more secure than a password, which can easily be compromised. This is why no one is doing more than we are to advance alternative modes of authentication. With Google Prompt, a simple tap will authenticate your account.



Making account security more seamless than ever

Weâre also building advanced security technologies into devices â like security keys on Android and the Google Smart Lock app on iOS â to make authentication seamless and even more secure than a password. Soon, weâll start automatically enrolling users in 2-Step Verification if they have a recovery phone or email on their account. Check your account with Security Checkup.
