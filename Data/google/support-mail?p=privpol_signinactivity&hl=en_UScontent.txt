See your account activity

On your computer, open Gmail.
In the bottom right, click Details.


Tip: You can also visit the Recent security events page to see security updates for your entire Google Account.
Information shown on the "Last account activity" page
The Last account activity page shows your sign-in records, and includes the information below.
Concurrent session information
In the "Concurrent session information" section, you'll see if you're signed in to Gmail on another device, browser, or location.
To sign out of all sessions except the one you have open in front of you, click Sign out all other Gmail web sessions.


Access type
In the "Access type" section, you'll see the browser, device, or mail server (like POP or IMAP) that you accessed Gmail from.
If you've authorized an application, you'll see the location (IP Address) of the 3rd party application. 


Location (IP address)
You can see the last 10 IP addresses and approximate locations that accessed your Gmail account.
If you got a warning about suspicious activity in your account, you might also see up to 3 additional IP addresses that have been labeled as suspicious.
There are a few reasons you may see multiple IP addresses or locations in your activity:

If you use POP or IMAP to read your mail on other services, like Apple Mail or Microsoft Outlook, this location information will be included, too.
If you use Mail Fetcher, a Google IP will show up because your messages are being fetched through a Google server.
If you use Gmail on a phone or tablet, your Internet service or mobile carrier's location may show up. This may be a location far from where you are. As long as the name of the carrier matches yours, this isn't unusual.



Troubleshoot problems

I think someone else has access to my account
If you don't recognize the activity on the page, like a location or access type, someone might have access to your account because of phishing or malware.

Immediately change your password.
Follow the Gmail security tips to help protect your account.
