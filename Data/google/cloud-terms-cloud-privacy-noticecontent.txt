 Google Cloud Privacy
                      Notice 





















Effective Date: April 20, 2022
This Google Cloud Privacy Notice describes how we collect
                      and process your personal information in relation
                      to Google Workspace, Google Workspace for Education and Google Cloud Platform (together,
                      “Cloud Services”).
We offer Cloud Services either directly or via our
                      authorized partners. Where we refer to our customers in
                      this notice, we also mean our partners and their
                      customers.












                            Information We Collect




Google processes Customer Data, Partner Data
                                and Service Data in order to provide Cloud
                                Services. This Privacy Notice applies solely to
                                Service Data and does
                                  not apply to Customer Data or
                                Partner Data.
Customer Data and Partner Data are defined in
                                our agreement(s) covering Cloud Services and
                                represent the data that you and our customers
                                provide for processing in Cloud Services. For
                                more information about how we process Customer
                                Data and Partner Data, see
                                our Google Workspace Data Processing Amendment, Google Cloud Platform Data Processing and Security Terms (Customers) and Google Cloud Platform Data Processing and Security Terms (Partners).
                              
Service Data is the personal information Google
                                collects or generates during the provision and
                                administration of the Cloud Services, excluding
                                any Customer Data and Partner Data. Service Data
                                includes:

Cloud payments and
                                    transactions. We keep
                                  reasonable business records of charges,
                                  payments, and billing details and issues.
Cloud settings and
                                    configurations. We record your
                                  configuration and settings, including resource
                                  identifiers and attributes. This includes
                                  service and security settings for data and
                                  other resources.
Technical and operational details of
                                    your usage of Cloud
                                    Services. We collect
                                  information about usage, operational status,
                                  software errors and crash reports,
                                  authentication credentials, quality and
                                  performance metrics, and other technical
                                  details necessary for us to operate and
                                  maintain Cloud Services and related software.
                                  This information may include device
                                  identifiers, identifiers from cookies or
                                  tokens, and IP addresses.
Your direct
                                    communications. We keep
                                  records of your communications and
                                  interactions with us and our partners, for
                                  example, when you provide feedback or contact
                                  information, ask questions or seek technical
                                  support.








                            Why We Process Data




Google processes Service Data for the following
                                purposes:

Provide Cloud Services you
                                    request. Service Data is
                                  primarily used to deliver the Cloud Services
                                  that you and our customers request. This
                                  includes a number of processing activities
                                  that are necessary to provide the Cloud
                                  Services, including processing to bill for
                                  services usage, to ensure services are working
                                  as intended, to detect and avoid outages or
                                  other problems you might experience, and to
                                  secure your data and the services you use.
                                
Make recommendations to optimize use
                                    of Cloud Services. We may
                                  process Service Data to provide you and our
                                  customers with recommendations and tips. These
                                  suggestions may include ways to better secure
                                  your account or data, options to reduce
                                  service charges or improve performance, and
                                  information about new or related products and
                                  features. We may also evaluate your response
                                  to our recommendations.
Maintain and improve Cloud
                                    Services. We evaluate Service
                                  Data to help us improve the performance and
                                  functionality of Cloud Services. As we
                                  optimize Cloud Services for you, this may
                                  improve them for our customers and vice versa.
                                
Provide and improve other services
                                    you request. We may use
                                  Service Data to deliver and improve other
                                  services that you and our customers request,
                                  including Google or third-party services that
                                  are enabled via the Cloud Services,
                                  administrative consoles, APIs, or the Google
                                  Cloud Platform Marketplace or Google Workspace
                                  Marketplace.
Assist you. We use
                                  Service Data when needed to provide technical
                                  support and professional services as requested
                                  by you and our customers, and to assess
                                  whether we have met your needs. We also use
                                  Service Data to improve our online support,
                                  and to communicate with you and our customers.
                                  This includes notifications about updates to
                                  Cloud Services, and responding to support
                                  requests.
Protect you, our users, the public,
                                    and Google. We use Service
                                  Data to improve the safety and reliability of
                                  our services. This includes detecting,
                                  preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse,
                                  security risks, and technical issues that
                                  could harm our users, our customers, the
                                  public, or Google. These activities are an
                                  important part of our commitment to secure our
                                  services.
Comply with legal
                                    obligations. We may need to
                                  process Service Data to comply with our legal
                                  obligations, for example, where we’re
                                  responding to legal process or an enforceable
                                  governmental request, or to meet our financial
                                  record-keeping obligations.
Other purposes with your
                                    consent. We may ask for your
                                  consent to process information for other
                                  purposes not covered in this Privacy Notice.
                                  You have the right to withdraw your consent at
                                  any time.

To achieve these purposes, we may use Service
                                Data together with information we collect from
                                other Google products and services. We may use
                                algorithms to recognize patterns in Service
                                Data. Manual collection and review of Service
                                Data may also occur, such as when you interact
                                directly with our billing or support teams. We
                                may aggregate and anonymize Service Data to
                                eliminate personal details, and we may use
                                Service Data for internal reporting and analysis
                                of applicable product and business operations.
                              







                            Where Data Is Stored




We maintain data centers around the world, and
                                provide Google Workspace and Google Workspace
                                for Education
                                from these locations, and
                                Google Cloud Platform
                                from these locations.
                                Service Data may be processed on servers located
                                outside of the country where our users and
                                customers are located because Service Data is
                                typically processed by centralized or
                                regionalized operations like billing, support,
                                and security.
Regardless of where Service Data is processed,
                                we apply the same protections described in this
                                Privacy Notice. When transferring Service Data
                                outside of the European Economic Area, we comply
                                with
                                certain legal frameworks.
                              







                            How We Secure Data




We build Cloud Services with strong security
                                features to protect information. The insights we
                                gain from providing our services help us detect
                                and automatically block security threats from
                                ever reaching you.
We work hard to protect you and Google from
                                unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
                                destruction of information we hold, including:
                              

We encrypt Service Data at rest and while in
                                  transit between our facilities.
We regularly review our information
                                  collection, storage, and processing practices,
                                  including physical security measures, to
                                  prevent unauthorized access to our systems.
                                
We restrict access to personal information
                                  to Google employees, contractors, and agents
                                  who need that information in order to process
                                  it for us. Anyone with this access is subject
                                  to strict contractual confidentiality
                                  obligations and may be disciplined or
                                  terminated if they fail to meet these
                                  obligations.








                            How We Share Data




We do not share Service Data with companies,
                                organizations, or individuals outside of Google
                                except in the following cases:


With your consent


We’ll share Service
                                Data outside of Google when we have your
                                consent. For example, when you or our customer
                                chooses to procure a third-party service through
                                the Google Cloud Platform Marketplace or Google
                                Workspace Marketplace, or use a third-party
                                application that requests access to your
                                information, we’ll seek permission to share
                                information with that third party.



With your administrators and authorized
                                    resellers


When you use Cloud
                                Services, your administrator and resellers
                                authorized to manage your or your organization’s
                                account will have access to certain Service
                                Data. For example, they may be able to:



View account and billing information,
                                      activity and statistics
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
                                    
Access your account information in order
                                      to satisfy applicable law, regulation,
                                      legal process, or enforceable governmental
                                      request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit
                                      your information or your privacy settings
                                    

For external processing


We provide
                                information to our affiliates, partners and
                                other trusted businesses or persons to process
                                it for us, based on our instructions and in
                                compliance with this Privacy Notice and other
                                appropriate confidentiality and security
                                measures.


For legal reasons


We may share
                                Service Data outside of Google if we have a
                                good-faith belief that access to, or use,
                                preservation, or disclosure of the information
                                is reasonably necessary to:



Comply with applicable law, regulation,
                                      legal process, or enforceable governmental
                                      request. We share information about the
                                      number and type of requests we receive
                                      from governments in
                                      our Transparency Report.
                                    
Enforce applicable agreements, including
                                      investigation of potential violations.
                                    
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address
                                      fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights,
                                      property or safety of Google, our
                                      customers, users, and the public as
                                      required or permitted by law.



If Google is
                                involved in a reorganization, merger,
                                acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue
                                to ensure the confidentiality of your personal
                                information and give affected users notice
                                before personal information becomes subject to a
                                different privacy policy.








                            Access to Data




Your organization may allow you to access and
                                export your data in order to back it up or
                                transfer it to a service outside of Google. Some
                                Google Cloud Services enable you to directly
                                access and download the data you have stored in
                                the services. For example, as further described
                                in
                                our Google Workspace Data Subject Requests Guide,
                                you or your organization may use various tools
                                to access, control, and export data.
You and your organization’s administrator can
                                access several categories of Service Data
                                directly from Google Cloud, including your
                                billing contact information, payment and
                                transaction information, as well as product and
                                communication settings and configurations.
If you’re otherwise unable to access your data,
                                you can always request
                                it here.
                              







                            Deletion and Retention of Data




We retain Service Data for different periods of
                                time depending on what it is, how we use it, and
                                how you configure your settings.
Service Data is deleted or anonymized once it
                                is no longer needed. For each type of data and
                                operation, we set retention timeframes based on
                                the purpose for its collection, and ensure it is
                                kept for no longer than necessary.
Sometimes we need to retain certain information
                                for an extended period of time for legitimate
                                business or legal purposes. For example, when
                                Google processes a payment for you, or when you
                                make a payment to Google, we’ll retain data
                                about those transactions as required for tax or
                                accounting purposes. Other legitimate business
                                or legal purposes that may require us to retain
                                data include security, fraud and abuse
                                prevention, ensuring continuity of our services,
                                and complying with legal or regulatory
                                requirements.
When we delete data, we follow detailed steps
                                to make sure that the data is securely and
                                completely removed from our active systems or
                                retained only in anonymized form. We take
                                measures to ensure that our services protect
                                information from accidental or malicious
                                deletion through the use of backup systems.







                            Using Google Accounts and Products




Your Google Account is your connection to all
                                Google products and services, not just Cloud
                                Services. When you choose to use Google products
                                and services outside of Cloud Services,
                                the Google Privacy Policy describes
                                how data (including your Google Account profile
                                information) is collected and used. You and your
                                administrator can control which other Google
                                services you may use while logged into a Google
                                Account managed by your organization.
If you interact with Cloud Services using a
                                Google Account managed by an organization, then
                                your personal information may be subject to your
                                organization’s privacy policies and processes,
                                and you should direct privacy inquiries to your
                                organization.







                            EU Privacy Standards and GDPR




If European Union (EU), UK or Swiss data
                                protection law applies to the processing of
                                information about you, you have certain rights,
                                including the rights to access, correct, delete
                                and export your information, as well as to
                                object to or request that we restrict processing
                                of your information.
For users based in the European Economic Area,
                                UK or Switzerland, the data controller
                                responsible for Service Data is Google Cloud
                                EMEA Ltd. However, where our customer has
                                entered into an agreement covering Cloud
                                Services with a different Google affiliate, that
                                affiliate will be the data controller
                                responsible for processing Service Data in
                                connection with billing for the Cloud Services
                                only.
If you want to exercise your data protection
                                rights with regard to information we process in
                                accordance with this Privacy Notice and are not
                                able to do so via the tools available to you or
                                your organization’s administrator, you can
                                always contact Google via
                                our Privacy Help Center.
                                And you can contact your local data protection
                                authority if you have concerns regarding your
                                rights under local law.
In addition to the purposes and grounds
                                described in this Privacy Notice, we may process
                                information on the following legal grounds:

Where necessary for the performance
                                    of a contract with you
We may process your information where
                                    necessary for us to enter into a contract
                                    with you or to comply with our contractual
                                    commitments to you.

When we’re complying with legal
                                    obligations
We’ll process your information when we have
                                    a legal obligation to do so.

When we’re pursuing legitimate
                                    interests
We may process Service Data based on our
                                    legitimate interests and those of third
                                    parties while applying appropriate
                                    safeguards that protect your privacy. This
                                    means that we process your information in
                                    the interests of providing Cloud Services
                                    you request; making recommendations to
                                    optimize use of Cloud Services; maintaining
                                    and improving Cloud Services; providing and
                                    improving other services you request;
                                    assisting you; and protecting against harm
                                    to the rights, property or safety of Google,
                                    our users, our customers, and the public, as
                                    required or permitted by law.

                            California Requirements




The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
                                requires specific disclosures for California
                                residents.
This Privacy Notice is designed to help you
                                understand how Google handles your information:
                              


We explain the categories of information
                                    Google collects and the sources of that
                                    information
                                    in Information We Collect.
                                  


We explain how Google uses information
                                    in Why We Process Data.
                                  


We explain when Google may share
                                    information
                                    in How We Share Data.
                                    Google does not sell your personal
                                    information.


The CCPA also provides the right to request
                                information about how Google collects, uses, and
                                discloses your personal information. And it
                                gives you the right to access your information
                                and request that Google delete that information.
                                Finally, the CCPA provides the right to not be
                                discriminated against for exercising your
                                privacy rights.
We provide
                                the information and tools described
                                in this Notice so you can exercise these rights.
                                When you use them, we’ll validate your request
                                by verifying your identity (for example, by
                                confirming that you’re signed in to your Google
                                Account). If you have questions or requests
                                related to your rights under the CCPA, you (or
                                your authorized agent) can
                                also contact Google.
                              
The CCPA requires a description of data
                                practices using specific categories. This table
                                uses these categories to organize the

                                deleted or anonymized once it is no longer
                                needed for the purposes described above. For
                                each type of data and operation, we set
                                retention timeframes based on the purpose for
                                its collection, and ensure it is kept for no
                                longer than necessary.
Deletion of personal
                                  information. If the retention

                                for retaining the information. When we receive a
                                request to delete personal information, the
                                retention period of the archive copy expires,
                                and then Google's archiving system has a
                                mechanism to overwrite the expired data. In some
                                cases, it may be necessary to store some data
                                for a variety of other reasons, such as
                                complying with legal obligations.
