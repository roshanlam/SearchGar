It used to be so good for framing the picture (black/white expansion) or adding missing areas with the smart expansion tool.1,503 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoJust Joshmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJune 1, 2022In my experience this is the best free photo editor in the Play Store. My only concern is why does it need permission to manage all files on the device? Any photo editor should only need permission for media, not ALL files on the device. The only reason I'm trusting it is because it's made by Google, but it still makes me a bit uncomfortable. If Google could enlighten me and ease my mind, that would be great. =)203 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoEvan Morrisonmore_vert Flag inappropriateMay 9, 2022Easy to use with many features. I have been using this app for years with no issues or complaints, everything is customizable. I don't have experience with actual photo editing software, so as a mobile app I have no comparison.. but I take shots of the moon and stars through my binoculars and use this app to edit, and it does wonders!265 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new‚Ä¢ Added support for a dark theme mode in Settings‚Ä¢ Bug fixesflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacy/Similar appsarrow_forwardPhoto Editor Pro - PolishInShot Inc.4.9starAdobe Lightroom: Photo EditorAdobe4.6starPhoto Lab Picture Editor & ArtLinerock Investments LTD4.6starSketchbookSketchbook3.6starPhotoshop Express Photo EditorAdobe4.3starInstasize Pic Editor + CollageInstasize, Inc.4.3starMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC3.9starGoogle ChatGoogle LLC4.0starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle Find My DeviceGoogle LLC4.4starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
