This is possibly my biggest complaint. Otherwise, I would rate Snapseed 5 stars. It is so simple yet absolutely outstanding to use. I love the layout and the many options to adjust your images exactly how you want them! The best feature by far is the ability to undo, tweak, or even completely change. It is very easy to customize and make your work as best as possible. I love Snapseed!1,014 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoBeth Scrogginsmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJune 14, 2022Great app! Bit of a learning curve so -1☆, but nothing too complicated, and there are tutorials I haven't dug into yet. Love that there are ZERO ads! That's awesome, thank you! Tons of tools! What I really love that other apps don't have, is the ability to go back into each edit and do some major fine tuning or artistic touches, save them as filters, and batch edit a whole collection! A favorite tool is "Expand" I have tried countless apps, and this is the only one with the feature,so TY!199 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoJosha Wuhmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJune 1, 2022In my experience this is the best free photo editor in the Play Store. My only concern is why does it need permission to manage all files on the device? Any photo editor should only need permission for media, not ALL files on the device. The only reason I'm trusting it is because it's made by Google, but it still makes me a bit uncomfortable. If Google could enlighten me and ease my mind, that would be great. =)681 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new• Added support for a dark theme mode in Settings• Bug fixesflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacy/Similar appsarrow_forwardLightroom Photo & Video EditorAdobe4.6starPhotoshop Express Photo EditorAdobe4.3starPresets for Lightroom - Kolorocerdillac4.6starSmugMug - Photography PlatformSmugMug Inc.4.7starPhoto Lab Picture Editor & ArtLinerock Investments LTD4.6starPhotoRoom Studio Photo EditorPhotoRoom Background Editor App4.7starMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle ChatGoogle LLC2.5starGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.1starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube KidsGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
