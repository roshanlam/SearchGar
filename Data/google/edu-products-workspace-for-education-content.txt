What editions does Google Workspace for Education offer?





Google Workspace for Education offers Education Fundamentals to all qualifying institutions at no cost. For those that want more premium features, Google also offers paid editions including Education Standard, the Teaching and Learning Upgrade, and Education Plus.


How much does each edition within Google Workspace for Education cost?





Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals is available at no cost for all qualifying institutions. Education Standard, the Teaching and Learning Upgrade, and Education Plus are paid editions.
For pricing information and specific features included in each of the Google Workspace for Education editions, please visit our comparison chart.


Are there differences in storage across editions?





All editions provide schools with 100TB of storage shared across the institution.  Additional storage is provided with the Teaching and Learning Upgrade and Education Plus editions based on the number of licenses purchased. Please review our comparison chart for more details or visit our Help Center.


Can I have more than one edition at the same time?





It depends and varies based on the intended combination of editions. 
You must have an Education Fundamentals edition to upgrade to any of the other editions (Education Standard, the Teaching and Learning Upgrade, or Education Plus).
You cannot have Education Plus in combination with Education Standard or the Teaching and Learning Upgrade â only Education Fundamentals.
You can have a combination of Education Standard and the Teaching and Learning Upgrade at the same time. Although we believe the maximum value of those combined editions can be realized in Education Plus, we wanted to be as flexible as possible to school community needs.


Are discounts available and/or are there incentives for longer term commitments?





Yes, Google offers automatic discounts for customers that contractually commit to a multi-year purchase (two years or more) of Google Workspace for Education Plus. To learn more, please connect with your Google Workspace for Education partner reseller and/or Google for Education representative.


When upgrading to a paid edition of Google Workspace for Education (Plus, Teaching & Learning Upgrade, and/or Standard), will I need to sign a New Workspace for EducationTerms of Service agreement?





No, there is no need for a new Workspace for Education contract nor an addendum.


Can I upgrade/downgrade between the editions?





All paid Google Workspace for Education editions are annual subscriptions, and pricing is locked for the duration of the subscription term. 
Customers who purchase the Teaching and Learning Upgrade can add Education Standard at any time (and vice versa) as well as upgrade to Education Plus.
Customers can reevaluate continuing with their subscription or downgrade at the end of their subscription term.


What is the duration of a paid Google Workspace for Education subscription?





All paid Google Workspace for Education editions are available as annual subscriptions, and pricing is locked for the duration of the subscription term. However, institutions can also purchase the Teaching and Learning Upgrade on a monthly subscription, as an alternative to purchasing it as an annual subscription.


Will schools that previously purchased G Suite Enterprise for Education automatically get access to all new features that come with Google Workspace for Education Plus?





Yes, all customers who have purchased G Suite Enterprise for Education will receive new features and functionality that are released to the new Google Workspace for Education editions.


Is it possible to trial the paid Google Workspace for Education editions?





Yes, our authorized Google Workspace for Education partners can provision 60 day trials for Education Plus, Education Standard, and the Teaching and Learning Upgrade. 50 licenses are provided for the trial.
