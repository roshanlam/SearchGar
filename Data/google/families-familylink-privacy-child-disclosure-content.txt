                        How and why does Google use my information?
                      

                        We may save information that you or your parent give us, like your name and birthday. We also save information when you use our apps and sites. We work hard to keep this information safe, and we use it for different reasons â like making Google apps and sites more helpful.
                      

                        With your parent, learn more about some ways we might use your information:
                      


Make our apps & sites work: For example, if you search for "puppies" on Google Search, we use your information to show you things about puppies.
                        

Make our apps & sites better: For example, if something is broken, we can use information to fix it.
                        

Protect Google, our users, and the public: We use information to keep people safer online.
                        

Make new apps & sites: We learn how people use our current apps and sites to get ideas for new Google things we can build.
                        

Show you things you might like: For example, if you like watching animal videos on YouTube Kids, we may show you more.
                        

Show you ads based on things like the site you're on.
                        

Communicate with you: For example, we might use your email address to message you. Always ask a parent before opening messages from someone you don't know.
                        





 



                        Can I tell Google what to save?
                      

                        Yes, you can change some of the things we save about you. If you make changes to some of your privacy settings, like Activity Controls, we'll let your parent know. They can help you change your settings, too.
                      

                        You and your parent can always see and manage some of the information about you and your Google Account.
                      




 



                        Does Google ever share my personal information with others?
                      

                        There are a few reasons we may share your personal information, like your name, outside of Google. If we share this information, we take steps to make sure it's protected.
                      

                        We may share some personal information:
                      

With your parent and family group on Google
                        
With companies we work with
                        
When your parent tells us itâs okay
                        
When we need to for legal reasons
                        





 



                        Who else can see what I share online?
                      

                        Anything you share online, like emails or photos, could be seen by lots of people. Only share with people you trust. If you're not sure, ask a parent or family member.

We work hard to keep this information safe, and we use it for things like making our products more useful to you. For example, we collect data to:
                      


Protect Google, our users, and the public: We use data to keep people safer online, like detecting and preventing fraud.
                        

Provide our services: We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results.
                        

Maintain & improve our services: For example, we can track when our products stop working as they're supposed to. And understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
                        

Develop new services: Data helps us develop new services. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Googleâs first photos app, Picasa, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
                        

Personalize content, which means showing things we think you might like. For example, if you like watching sports videos on YouTube we may recommend more to watch.
                        

Show you ads based on information like the site youâre on, search terms youâve entered, or your city and state.
                        

Measure performance: We use data to measure performance and understand how our services are used.

                        You can always see and manage some of the information about you and your Google Account.
                      




 



                        Does Google ever share my personal information with others?
                      

                        We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases, like when weâre legally required to. If we share this information, we take steps to make sure it's protected.
                      

                        We may share some personal information:
                      


With your parent and family group on Google.
                        

ââWhen you and your parent give us permission, or for legal reasons. We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to:
                        
Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.
                        
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
                        
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
                        
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions.
                        





 



                        Who else can see the things I share, such as photos, email, and documents?
                      

                        You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google apps and sites that you use.
                      

                        Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google.
                      

                        You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared.
                      

                        Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust.
                      

                        To learn more about these topics, you can always check out our Privacy Policy.
