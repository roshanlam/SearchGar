See what you can do with Google Sheets 











                    Collaborate on data, from anywhere
                  


                      Establish a ground truth for data in your online spreadsheet, with easy sharing and real-time editing. Use comments and assign action items to keep analysis flowing.
                    




   








                    Get to insights faster with built-in intelligence
                  


                      Assistive features like Smart Fill and formula suggestions help you analyze faster with fewer errors. And get insights quickly by asking questions about your data in simple language.
                    




   







                    Seamlessly connect to other Google apps
                  


                      Sheets is thoughtfully connected to other Google apps you love, saving you time. Easily analyze Google Forms data in Sheets, or embed Sheets charts in Google Slides and Docs. You can also reply to comments directly from Gmail and easily present your spreadsheets to Google Meet.
                    




   






                    Extend collaboration and intelligence to Excel files
                  


                      Easily edit Microsoft Excel spreadsheets online without converting them, and layer on Sheetsâ enhanced collaborative and assistive features like comments, action items, and Smart Fill.
                    




   










                  Build custom solutions
                

                  Speed up workflows by building business apps and automations. Use AppSheet to build custom applications on top of Sheets, without writing code. Or add custom functions, menu items, and macros with Apps Script.
                




                  Always work with fresh data
                

                  With Sheets, everyoneâs always working on the latest version of a spreadsheet. And with edits automatically saved in version history, itâs easy to undo changes or even see edit history of an individual spreadsheet cell.
                




                  Seamlessly connect to critical data
                

                  Pull in and analyze data from the other tools you use, like customer data from Salesforce. Enterprise customers can also use Connected Sheets to analyze billions of rows of BigQuery data in Sheets â without writing any code.
                








              Security, compliance, and privacy
            

   






                      Secure by default
                    

                      We use industry-leading security measures to keep your data safe, including advanced malware protections. Sheets is also cloud-native, eliminating the need for local files and minimizing risk to your devices.
                    



                      Encryption in transit and at rest
                    

                      All files uploaded to Google Drive or created in Sheets are encrypted in transit and at rest.
                    



                      Compliance to support regulatory requirements
                    

                      Our products, including Sheets, regularly undergo independent verification of their security, privacy, and compliance controls.
                    




                    Private by design
                  

                    Sheets adheres to the same robust privacy commitments and data protections as the rest of Google Cloudâs enterprise services.
                  


                      You control your data.
                    


                      We never use your Sheets content for ad purposes.
                    


                      We never sell your personal information to third parties.
