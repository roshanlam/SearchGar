My biggest issue with this app is very simple, but very annoying. I search for someone, I call them, finish the call. If I want to call someone in favorites...., I click on Favorites, but there's nobody there, because the search filter is still on (also, no dial option while searching)...so I have to back out of the search function and then it works. It's simple, when I hit Favorites can't you automatically clear the search?1,963 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMichael Cmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 6, 2022No option to display only contacts with phone numbers, one of the most basic features in every contacts app in every other phone I've ever had. Unfortunately, my new phone came preinstalled with this garbage with no other option but to take my chances with finding something else in the play store. The fact that this app is missing one of the most basic, common, and necessary features is a huge FAIL!3,885 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMatt Davismore_vert Flag inappropriateFebruary 21, 2022'Contacts' is, as you would guess, an app that allows you to manage your contacts list. It works like it should, syncs automatically across all my devices, and has a clean UI. I rarely use the 'Contacts' app directly; I mostly interact with it through the contacts list in Google's Phone Dialer. It's powered by this app; you can test this out by disabling 'Contacts' and then trying to add a contact to Phone's contacts - it'll say "No contacts app installed". I like this app/service.
