Unfortunately, my new phone came preinstalled with this garbage with no other option but to take my chances with finding something else in the play store. The fact that this app is missing one of the most basic, common, and necessary features is a huge FAIL!2,732 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoTimothy Riosmore_vert Flag inappropriateFebruary 15, 2022Poorly programmed, no options, one size doesn't fit all. My biggest issue with this app is very simple, but very annoying. I search for someone, I call them, finish the call. If I want to call someone in favorites...., I click on Favorites, but there's nobody there, because the search filter is still on (also, no dial option while searching)...so I have to back out of the search function and then it works. It's simple, when I hit Favorites can't you automatically clear the search?1,478 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoM. Davismore_vert Flag inappropriateFebruary 21, 2022'Contacts' is, as you would guess, an app that allows you to manage your contacts list. It works like it should, syncs automatically across all my devices, and has a clean UI. I rarely use the 'Contacts' app directly; I mostly interact with it through the contacts list in Google's Phone Dialer. It's powered by this app; you can test this out by disabling 'Contacts' and then trying to add a contact to Phone's contacts - it'll say "No contacts app installed". I like this app/service. Thanks.1,445 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new• Bug fixes and stability improvementsflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacyMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC3.9starGoogle ChatGoogle LLC4.0starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle Find My DeviceGoogle LLC4.4starSimilar appsarrow_forwardAddress BookAI Droid4.6starContacts+Contacts Plus team4.0starDialer, Phone, Call Block & Contacts by SimplerSimpler Apps Inc4.3starTalkatone: Texting & CallingTalkatone, Llc4.1starDW Contacts & Phone & SMSDWP4.2star$9.49GPS Navigation - Route FinderHandy Tools Studio4.5starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
