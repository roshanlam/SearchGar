                    Built-in protections against malware, spam, and ransomware
                  


                      Drive can provide encrypted and secure access to your files. Files shared with you can be proactively scanned and removed when malware, spam, ransomware, or phishing is detected. And Drive is cloud-native, which eliminates the need for local files and can minimize risk to your devices.
                    




   







                    People-first collaboration apps to supercharge teamwork
                  


                      Drive integrates with Docs, Sheets, and Slides, cloud-native collaboration apps that enable your team to create content and collaborate more effectively in real time.
                    




   






                    Integration with the tools and apps your team is already using
                  


                      Drive integrates with and complements your teamâs existing technology. Collaborate in Microsoft Office files without the need to convert file formats, and edit and store over 100 additional file types, including PDFs, CAD files, images, and more.
                    




   






                    Googleâs Search and AI technology helps your team move faster
                  


                      Googleâs powerful search capabilities are embedded in Drive and offer speed, reliability, and collaboration. And features like Drive search chips help your team find files fast by quickly surfacing more relevant results.

                        âI never worry about finding a document. Everythingâs in Drive, I can access it anywhere, and thatâs been revolutionary.â
