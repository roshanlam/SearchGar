When the audio recordings setting is off, voice inputs from interactions with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps won't be saved to your Google Account, even if you're signed in. If you turn the audio recordings setting off, previously saved audio is not deleted. You can delete your audio recordings at any time.

Google may delete audio sooner than the timeframe you choose, once it's no longer needed for developing and improving Google’s audio recognition technologies and the services that use them. For example, less audio may be needed for some languages over time.





Other places audio recordings may be saved 
The audio recordings setting does not affect other Google services (like Google Voice or YouTube) that you may use to save audio information.
Depending on other device settings, audio recordings may still be saved on your device. For example, if you turn on Voice Match, audio recordings may be saved on your device to help recognize your voice. 
On-device audio can be used to improve audio recognition technologies on the device. Those improvements can be sent to Google, without audio recordings, to help develop and improve audio recognition technologies and the Google services that use them, for example, when the Improve Gboard setting is on, Gboard can improve recognition for everyone without sending what you say to the server. Learn how Gboard gets better.

How audio recordings work

How audio recordings are saved


Google records your voice and audio, plus a few seconds before, when you use audio activations like:

Tapping the microphone icon.
Pressing the talk button on a headset.
Saying activation commands like "Hey Google."

Important: Audio might be saved if your device incorrectly detects an activation. For example, this can happen if there's a noise that sounds like “Hey Google” or an unintended manual activation. We’re constantly working to make our systems better at reducing unintended activations.
When the audio recordings setting is turned on 
Your audio is saved to your Google Account only when:

"Include audio recordings" is checked, and,
You're signed in to your Google Account and, 
Web & App Activity is turned on and, 
You interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps

If you use your device without an internet connection, audio may be saved in your account once you return online. 



How audio recordings improve your experience


Audio recordings are used to: 

Develop and improve our audio recognition technologies and the Google services that use them, like Google Assistant. 
Better recognize your voice over time. For example, your devices that have Voice Match enabled may better recognize when you say “Hey Google.”





How audio review improves our technologies


To help Google services better understand what people say to them, trained reviewers analyze a small percentage of machine-selected audio samples. 
To analyze and better interpret a sample of audio, trained reviewers listen to, transcribe, and annotate the sample. For example, a sample might include audio of what someone is saying in a noisy environment or in a particular language. 
We take steps to protect your privacy during the analysis. For example, your audio is disassociated from your account when reviewers access it.
