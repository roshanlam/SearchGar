Founded in the 10th Century, this opulent palace was a seat of regional power.Amer is situated amidst the Kalikho hills, protected by nearby Jaigarh Fort. Optimizing on its hilly landscape, Amer was designed in ascending levels from public to private spaces.  The magnificently painted Ganesh Pol served as a monumental gateway into the palace's private quarters. It depicts the Hindu elephant-headed deity of auspicious beginnings on its central entrance.Suhag mandir (good fortune temple) is a small pavilion with jharokhas screened by intricately carved marble jaalis. From these protected areas, women could remain unseen while watching royal processions in the courtyard below. Modern visitors are still enthralled by Amer's immense hallways and thick fortress walls. Inside the fort, they encounter towering walls of sandstone and marble interspersed with intricate glass and metalwork. With history spanning hundreds of years, Amer Fort requires a management plan that can holistically protect both tangible features such as art work, and intangible elements including living traditions. Working with the Rajasthan government, organizations such as Global Heritage Fund have supported the creation of a comprehensive management plan balancing site protection with local community interests.In collaboration with regional partners, local people, and the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, the plan will help protect Amer Fort for present and future generations.Now discover sites in...Barcelona, SpainMercado de La BoqueriaAquiles BatiztutzziCasa MilàMontesol, Javier MontesolLa Rambla, BarcelonaPort of BarcelonaMontesol, Javier MontesolPasseig de Gràcia, BarcelonaMontesol, Javier MontesolSagrada FamíliaMontesol, Javier MontesolParc del Laberint d'HortaJoaquim MirExplore moreLoadingExplore Martin Luther King Jr.'s MemorialSee the monument in Virtual RealityExplore moreRecommended for youDiscover popular artworks and hidden gems from around the worldLife lifeChoi, JeonghwaHappy HappyVisually similar workREDCreated around the same timeSignFrom related movementPlasticaFrom same collectionHeartDepicts same objectCHANDELIERCreated around the same timeLovely ThingsFrom related movementExplore with Street ViewSee the sites from homeExploreSan GimignanoItalyExploreSydney Opera HouseAustraliaExploreSuwon Hwaseong FortressSouth KoreaExploreOpen WallsBaltimoreFind your doppelganger Pet PortraitsMatch Your pet to a paintingArt SelfieMatch yourself to artWhat are you looking for?Start your cultural adventure PlacesExplore over 10,000 placesExplore MuseumsInside over 2,000 museumsExplore ArtworksDiscover over 100,000 artworksExplore GamesColoring, crosswords, and moreExploreExplore Pocket GalleriesStep inside a gallery from home Inside the Jean Pigozzi CollectionArt from Africa to Japan Meet VermeerAll of the artist’s paintings together for the first time Discover Indian MiniaturesSee the tiny works up close Enjoy an Audio Art TourWhere sound and art come together Getty Museum: Immersive ExperienceDiscover paintings from Los Angeles' iconic collection Explore Klimt's MasterpiecesA never-before-seen gallery of the artist's works Discover the Art of ColorSee artworks from around the world Enter a Kandinsky ExhibitionView the artist's work in a virtual galleryWhat's your favorite color?Discover over 100,000 artworks by colorOrangeYellowGreenTealBluePurplePinkRedForward slashFontana slashed holes into his canvases to make the viewer rethink the idea of 'space', in a simple but futuristic move he called "art for the Space Age".Darkness and depthFontana lined the backs of these pictures with a black gauze, which gives the illusion of endless depth behind.Serial slasherThis is one of many slashed canvases Fontana made from the 1950s onwards, some cut just once, and some multiple times.Concetto spaziale, Lucio Fontana, 1961Click on the dots to zoom into the detailsExploreRecommended for youDiscover popular artworks and hidden gems from around the worldSound of TsuzumiShoen UemuraYoung LadiesFrom same collectionCatching FirefliesFrom related movementPuppet MasterBy same artistFlower Basket (inspired by Noh-Play)Uses same mediumYoung Ladies Planting RiceCreated around the same timeDancing in the Flames (Important Cultural Property)Uses same mediumHydrangeasFrom related movementFrom art to historyDiscover culture through familiar masterpiecesYou Know Rodin's 'The Thinker'......But What About These Peruvian Thinkers7 skirts from 7 countriesFrom the Sarong to the kiltThe RahadSudanThe SarongIndonesiaThe KaunakesMesopotamiaThe ShendytEgyptThe LhobaTibetThe KiltScotlandThe DongChinaMusic + artThe Last Supper x BeethovenSit back and enjoy the masterpiece with the 'Moonlight Sonata'WatchZoom into masterpiecesMusic's biggest names narrate famous artworks Matty Healy x Piet MondrianThe 1975 frontman searches for a collective utopia Zoom Into Mondrian's 'Large Composition'Get lost in the visual vocabulary of red, blue, and yellowZoom into another artworkSpotlight on Inuit strengthExplore stories of Inuit resilience and perseveranceStories from the Arctic CoastMeet the Community Defined by ClimateOne Place, Generations of StoriesExplore moreExplore museums in PortugalDiscover the art, culture, fashion, and music of LisbonNational Museum of Contemporary Art -
