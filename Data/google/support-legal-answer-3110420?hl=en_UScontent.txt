Requesting content removals from Google products for Legal reasons
We take inappropriate content seriously
If you see content on a Google product that you believe violates the law or your rights, let us know. We’ll review the material and consider blocking, limiting, or removing access to it. Behaviors like phishing, violence, or explicit content may also violate our product policies and qualify for removal from Google products. Before creating a request, try to flag the content in the relevant product.

Transparency at our core

Transparency is a core value at Google. 
As part of our efforts to remain transparent, a copy of each legal notice we receive may be sent to the Lumen project for publication. Lumen is an independent research project managed by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School. The Lumen database houses millions of content takedown requests that have been voluntarily shared by various companies, including Google. Its purpose is to facilitate academic and industry research concerning the availability of online content. Lumen will redact the submitter's personal contact information (i.e. phone number, e-mail, and address).
You can view an example of a Lumen Publication here.
We may also publish similar information from your notice to our Transparency Report which provides data on the requests we receive from copyright owners and governments to remove information from our products.

Understanding copyright

It is Google's policy to comply with notices of copyright infringement pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. To read more about our copyright policies and the requirements of a complete notice, visit our Copyright Help Center.
