The main problem is the way tables are rendered on a small screen: they're very difficult to scroll horizontally and the rows cannot be sorted by column. Also, when editing an article, this app trashes edits, without warning, if a browser or other app loads another article. Finally, the inability to pinch zoom images drives me bananas.337 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKeith Mossmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyFebruary 28, 2022Best user interface and functionality of any app I've ever used. So many convenient features. Smooth finish and many customization/theme options are available. I never have issues with this app being slow. Desperately needs a "return to home page" button for when you're knee deep in a rabbit hole of articles.489 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoYesterdayTodayAndTomorrowmore_vert Flag inappropriateFebruary 12, 2019It *was* better, but the update(s) have now made it clumsy and difficult-to-navigate. Word to developers: the text runs *right up* to the right-side border and has some left-right movement. I'm constantly sliding the app's pages to the left so that I can read the end of the sentence. It's not looking like it was well-crafted. And the new tabbing: yuk. Somewhat poor in terms of usability. I've seen you guys do better. I know you can. I'm a donor, so maybe give a listen.22 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new- Minor bug fixes and enhancements.flagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper policyhttp://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policySimilar appsarrow_forwardKhan AcademyKhan Academy4.3starRadio USA - Live Radio FM / AMAppMind-Radio FM, Radio Online4.6starGrasshopper: Learn to CodeGoogle LLC4.4starBBC NewsBBC Studios Limited4.3starSmart Tools - UtilitiesPC Mehanik4.5starTuneIn Radio: News, Music & FMTuneIn Inc4.7starMore by Wikimedia Foundationarrow_forwardWikipedia BetaWikimedia Foundation4.6starWikimedia CommonsWikimedia Foundation4.3starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
