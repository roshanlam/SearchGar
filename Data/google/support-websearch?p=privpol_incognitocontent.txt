To browse the web privately, you can use private browsing, sign out of your account, change your custom results settings, or delete past activity.
If you want to search the web without saving your search activity to your account, you can use private browsing mode in a browser (like Chrome or Safari).

How private browsing works
Private browsing works differently depending on which browser you use. Browsing in private usually means:

The searches you do or sites you visit won't be saved to your device or browsing history.
Files you download or bookmarks you create might be kept on your device.
Cookies are deleted after you close your private browsing window or tab.
You might see search results and suggestions based on your location or other searches you've done during your current browsing session.


Important: If you sign in to your Google Account to use a web service like Gmail, your searches and browsing activity might be saved to your account.

Sign out of your Google Account

If you see the "Sign in" button, you’re already signed out of your account.
