                Stand on the shoulders of giants
              

                Google Scholar provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature.
                From one place, you can search across many disciplines and sources: articles,
                theses, books, abstracts and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional
                societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites. Google Scholar
                helps you find relevant work across the world of scholarly research.
              

















                How are documents ranked?
              

                Google Scholar aims to rank documents the way researchers do, weighing the full
                text of each document, where it was published, who it was written by, as well as
                how often and how recently it has been cited in other scholarly literature.
