Can't even remember if I downloaded it or if it came with my new phone. But it allowed me to delete an old player that I kept simply because it was the only that did a very specific thing. This does everything I want it to and it does it well. My only issue is at some point the voice speed changed. Only two settings that affect the speed now, each is either too fast or too slow in my opinion. Add a speak speed setting and it's perfect.656 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoNae Alliemore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJuly 21, 2022Originally 5 stars for the free read along. But you can not set a timer, so sometimes I will fall asleep and wake up to the book finished. This app also has a hard time catching up to the read along. Sometimes, the book will say I am on page 40, but the read aloud is reading page 120..it doesn't always synch. (This could also be my older phone. I still love this app, though, and I have found myself using this over my kindle more and more59 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoJESSI WOLFEmore_vert Flag inappropriateJuly 5, 2022This is one of the most frustrating apps I've used in awhile. I can hardly get it to download anything and it's super slow. It keeps telling me to refresh the library when my downloads fail and it takes forever to do that! And you can't even keep the book files you do download, not even the free ones. There's better reading apps out there. Google has some good stuff but this isn't one of them.147 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCJuly 5, 2022Sorry you're having issues with your book, Jessi.
