My high-speed internet works perfectly, was well. Lately, reading books allowed started taking frequent breaks, mainly if 'more natural voice' is toggled. They are quite annoying as I'm not used to them. I should get what I bought. Put a refresh button or fix it one way or another, I'm sick of downloading several times each book I'm reading...1,483 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKevin Lmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 1, 2022This app is useful, but it could easily be a lot better. What I love is that it saves my notes and highlights to Drive and syncs them across devices. Some things I hate about this app: (1) You can't adjust play speed in the app. (2) No pause, play, or skip buttons on the main screen. You have to use the pull-down menu. (3) You can't highlight something that starts and ends on separate pages. You have to make two separate highlights. (4) It won't read PDF books aloud.1,192 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMark Rehbergermore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyMay 7, 2022After trying out a few other apps, I ended up giving Google Books a chance. After all, how good could a free app really be?! I was very surprised how much better this app was for epub files than some of the for-purchase/subscription apps. The two pages view is flawless. I was specifically looking for that feature for children's picture books. Other apps struggled with that feature. I am very happy now.613 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new* Organize your library into shelves* Filter search results by price, price drops, reading language, age range, special reading features, and more* Download new books to an SD card* Track your reading progress in ebooks* Bug fixes, enhancements, and performance improvementsflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttps://play.google.com/books/intl/privacy.htmlSimilar appsarrow_forwardAmazon KindleAmazon Mobile LLC4.7stareBay: The shopping marketplaceeBay Mobile4.7starAudible: audiobooks & podcastsAudible, Inc4.6starTrendyol - Online ShoppingTrendyol4.1stareBoox: ePub PDF e-book ReaderREADING APPS4.6starAmazon ShoppingAmazon Mobile LLC4.7starMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC3.9starGoogle ChatGoogle LLC4.0starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle Find My DeviceGoogle LLC4.4starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
