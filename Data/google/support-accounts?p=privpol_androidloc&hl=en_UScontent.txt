When Google Location Accuracy is on

When you have Google Location Accuracy turned on, your phone uses these sources to get the most accurate location:

GPS
Wi-Fi
Mobile networks
Sensors (such as accelerometer)

Google may collect location data periodically and use this data in an anonymous way to improve location accuracy and location-based services.



When Google Location Accuracy is off

When you turn off Google Location Accuracy, your phone uses GPS and sensors, like accelerometer, to determine location. GPS can be slower and less accurate than other sources.
When Google Location Accuracy is off, GPS, Wi-Fi, network, and sensor data are not used or collected by Google Location Accuracy.
For Android 12 and higher, you can manage each app’s permission to access precise location. This is different from Google Location Accuracy, which is a location setting for your device that allows your phone to use more sources for the most accurate location.  Even with Google Location Accuracy on, you can grant an app only approximate location permission if you don't want to allow it access to your device’s precise location.  If you turn off Google Location Accuracy, apps may not be able to get your device’s precise location. Learn how to manage app location permissions.

Send your location in an emergency
To help first responders find you quickly, your phone’s location can be sent when you dial or text an emergency number. For example, dialing 911 in the US or 112 in Europe.
If Android Emergency Location Service (ELS) works in your country and on your mobile network, and you haven't turned off ELS, your phone will automatically send its location to first responders using ELS. If ELS is off, your mobile carrier may still send the device's location during an emergency call or text.

Turn Android Emergency Location Service on or off
You can turn Emergency Location Service on or off at any time.

Tip: Learn how to get help in an emergency.
How Emergency Location Service works
ELS is only activated when you call or text a local emergency number.
During your emergency call, ELS may use Google Location Accuracy and other information to get the most accurate location possible for the device.
Your phone sends its location to authorized emergency partners for the purpose of helping emergency services locate you. Your location is sent directly from your phone to emergency partners.
After a completed emergency call or text during which ELS was active, your phone may send deidentified usage and analytics data to Google for the purpose of analyzing how well ELS works. This information doesn’t include the location sent to authorized emergency partners, and doesn't identify you.

Tip: When ELS sends your location to authorized emergency partners, it’s different from when you share location via Google Maps. Learn about Location Sharing with Google Maps.
