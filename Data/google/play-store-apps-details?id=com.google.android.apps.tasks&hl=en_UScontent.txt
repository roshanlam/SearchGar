I love subtasks! Great enhancement! A way to reorder the tasks within the list would be a nice enhancement too. Something like drag and drop? Don't need sort, just a way to move tasks up or down individually. Original: I like it. However, I find it difficult to add a reminder from Gmail to Tasks. Sometimes can find the option, sometimes not. I want to seamlessly add a task from Gmail and from Google calendar.8 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSpirit0Linkmore_vert Flag inappropriateJune 4, 2022Using Tasks for many years. I like the app, don't us it often. I do my best to use it. I know this is out of the blue but I feel like maybe a small animation for completed a task or list may be nice. As an option that can be turned off and on. It not that big but I feel like it can do something for certain people.5 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoCharles Copleymore_vert Flag inappropriateJune 4, 2022I love how simple and clean this app is, but I have one request, to add a "today" view to it. It messes my brain that I have to go to Calendsr to utilize such a function, because other task apps have a "today" function in theirs. Some old us only go into our Calendar all for big items, but use our task apps for more minute to-do things, and having that dedicated feature, instead of going through all my list, would help out.7 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new• Easily create a new task by long-pressing on the app icon• Create a task by sharing from other apps• General improvements and bug fixesflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacyMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC3.9starGoogle ChatGoogle LLC4.0starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle Find My DeviceGoogle LLC4.4starSimilar appsarrow_forwardTodoist: To-Do List & TasksDoist4.5starGTasks: Todo List & Task ListAppest Inc.3.1starTo-Do List - Schedule PlannerDairy App & Notes & Audio Editor & Voice Recorder4.7star135 Todo List: Manage Daily Tasks for ProductivityAppscape Studios4.5starMyLifeOrganized: To-Do Listwww.mylifeorganized.net4.5starMicrosoft To Do: Lists & TasksMicrosoft Corporation4.5starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
