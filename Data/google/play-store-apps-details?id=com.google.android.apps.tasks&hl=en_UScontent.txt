You can make as many lists as you want (correct.), but there's no way to change the order in which they appear (unconscionable.). You can manually arrange individual tasks, but the only way to rearrange the lists themselves is to remake them in the desired order. They recently added the option to "star" tasks, but lists have been impossible to reorder for years. Also there's only one level of nesting for subtasks, which is weird.214 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoCreemore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJuly 13, 2022Overall it's good and easy to use but it needs more features. Such as give me the option to hide/show individual tasks on my calendar, change colors of tasks by group or individually, and rearrange groups are all must haves. I like that it links with my calendar but now my calendar is just filled with all of my daily reminders that and I do not want them there.59 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAngel Rochester Chaneymore_vert Flag inappropriateJuly 21, 2022Love the flexibility...can use with multiple applications like email, images, reminders, etc. However font manipulation is too limited, and the recurring scheduling is difficult to navigate. Having a repetition for just the "next ___ days" would be so much simpler than it is now.8 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's new• Easily create a new task by long-pressing on the app icon• Create a task by sharing from other apps• General improvements and bug fixesflagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043verified_userPrivacy policyhttp://www.google.com/policies/privacySimilar appsarrow_forwardGTasks: Todo List & Task ListAppest Inc.3.1starTasks: to do list & tasksPocket Brilliance Limited4.8starMyLifeOrganized: To-Do Listwww.mylifeorganized.net4.5starAny.do - To do list & CalendarAny.do To-do list & Calendar4.4starTo-do List & Tasks & PlannerTodobit4.5starTrello: Manage Team ProjectsTrello, Inc.4.3starMore by Google LLCarrow_forwardGoogle ChatGoogle LLC2.5starGoogle Pay: Save, Pay, ManageGoogle LLC4.1starYouTube TV: Live TV & moreGoogle LLC4.0starYouTube KidsGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle TranslateGoogle LLC4.4starGoogle HomeGoogle LLC4.3starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
