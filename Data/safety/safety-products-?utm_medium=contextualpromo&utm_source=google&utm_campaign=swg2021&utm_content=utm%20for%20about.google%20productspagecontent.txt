Safe, high-quality results

We work hard to ensure that you see helpful, high-quality search results and not web spam, such as sites that donât deliver on the promise of high quality content or employ tactics that might prove harmful to users. Weâre continuously improving our spam-fighting technology and working with those beyond Google to support a high-quality, safer web.



Your searches are secure

All searches on google.com and in the Google app are protected by encryption.

        Google Photos
      





Keeping your information safe

Features like face grouping making it easy to search and manage your photos. However, face groups and labels are only visible to you and we do not make general purpose facial recognition technology commercially available.



Putting you in control

We build easy-to-use tools that help put you in control of your Google Photos experience. You can selectively back up the photos you want stored in the cloud, securely share your photos, turn off face groups and labels to delete them from your account, and make edits to location information.

Google Assistant is designed for privacy.
















        
        Google Assistant
      





Starts in standby

Google Assistant is designed to wait in standby mode until it detects an activation, like when it hears  âHey Google.â When in standby mode, your Assistant wonât send what you are saying to Google or anyone else.
Once Google Assistant detects an activation, it exits standby mode and sends your request to Google servers. This can also happen if there is a noise that sounds like âHey Googleâ or an unintended manual activation.



Designed for privacy

By default, we donât retain your Google Assistant audio recordings. Visit âYour data in the Google Assistantâ to learn more about how your data makes Google Assistant work for you.



Easy-to-use privacy controls

To control which interactions are stored, just say something like âHey Google, delete what I said this week,â and Google Assistant will delete those interactions in âMy Activity.â



Guest Mode

With Google Assistantâs Guest Mode, you now have even more control over your Assistant activity on your home devices. By saying âHey Google, turn on Guest Mode,â you can turn on Guest Mode whenever you donât want Assistant interactions to be saved to your Google Account or used to personalize your experience.

The platform designed to protect.
















        
        Android
      





Google Play Protect

Google Play Protect automatically scans your apps to make sure theyâre safe. If you come across a bad app, weâll quickly alert you and instruct you on how to remove the app from your device.



App permissions

Apps you download use data on your device to make their functionality more useful. App permissions give you control over if and when an app can access different types of data on your device, such as contacts, photos, and location.



Phishing protections

Phishing occurs when someone tries to trick you into giving them your private information. Android alerts you to spammers, and Call Screen let you ask who's calling before you ever pick up the phone.

A safer way to pay,  every day.
















        
        Google Pay
      





Only you can pay with your phone

Google Pay requires authentication â via a pin, pattern or biometric â to open the app or pay a person. That means no one but you can make payments or see your information if your phone goes missing.



Easy-to-use privacy controls

When you sign up for Google Pay, you can choose whether youâd like to use your transaction history to personalize your experience within the app or not. That setting is not on by default, and weâve created a way that you can try it for three months to see if you like it. At the end of three months, you can decide if you want to keep it on or off.



Your card details aren't shared

Contactless payments are more secure than swiping your card because merchants wonât receive your real card number. Google Pay uses a Virtual Account Number that protects your payment info.
