Official Wikipedia app for iOSDeveloper(s)Wikimedia FoundationRepositoryAndroidiOSWebsitedoc.wikimedia.org
A number of organizations within the Wikimedia movement including the Wikimedia Foundation publish official mobile apps for using Wikipedia on mobile device operating systems. All are available for free via the appropriate app store (e.g. Google Play, App Store, Microsoft Store, F-droid). They can also be downloaded independently of any third party store, from the Wikimedia Foundation's releases website, which also keeps old and beta versions.[1]
Independent developers have also released many unofficial apps for reading Wikipedia articles. Some apps load content from the Wikipedia site and process it; other apps use the MediaWiki API. Some only display Wikipedia content, usually omitting some features such as categories and talk pages. Some allow editing.

Official apps
Main page: Help:Mobile access
Wikimedia Foundation
Wikipedia apps from the Wikimedia Foundation are called "Wikipedia".

Android
The Android app allows editing articles directly from the app. It is also available on Aptoide,[2] Cafe Bazaar,[3] F-Droid,[4] and GetJar.[5]
iOS
The iOS app also provides a read and write version of Wikipedia,[6] similar to the mobile web version. It allows users to share an article via Facebook and other social websites. It also allows users to find geotagged articles near their current location. It does not allow users to see categories or see the normal desktop version.
Windows
The Metro-style app provides a read-only version of Wikipedia, similar to the mobile web version. The app when used in Windows RT is incapable of showing moving pictures.
Kiwix
Kiwix has developed a number of offline apps based on Wikipedia content.

A number of apps for Wikipedia's sister projects exist. These include the Wiki Loves Monuments app, written for a 2012 photo contest, as an aid for Wikiphotographers. It shows a map of nearby national heritage register items, indicating whether Wikipedia had a photo for the site, and enabling quick and easy photo uploads for camera phones. It is not integrated with the official article display app.
There is an Android app for Wikimedia Commons which is community maintained, and described on the Commons mobile app page. There is also an Android app for Wiktionary, although it is no longer supported and has not been updated since August 2013.
