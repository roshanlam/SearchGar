                              JOHN A. POWELL: How do we actually create a world
                              in which our shared humanity becomes real, a world
                              where everyone can belong?
                            

                              MAYA SCOTT: Very much in our lives, weâre invited
                              to watch or listen, instead of witnessing or
                              doing.
                            

                              MAMBU BAYOH: How do we make sure that when someone
                              takes a photo of them, they see themselves?
                            

                              PERNELL CEZAR: We have a role and requirement to
                              do right by the communities that we come from.
                            

                              LUCY PINTO: We know that the starting point is
                              uneven. But we can generate equitable outcomes and
                              give everybody a level playing field.
                            

                              PEDRO PINA: If we are to be producing products and
                              services that are for everyone, we need to look at
                              ourselves and we need to see our users in
                              ourselves.
                            

                              JUAN RAJLIN: What weâre trying to create is a
                              culture where literally everyone can reach their
                              full potential.
                            

                              GIRL: It feels nice not to be like, âOh, sheâs a
                              special kid. We got to do everything different
                              just for her.â
                            

                              FEMALE VOICE: Who is that, Owen? Who is that?
                              Thatâs you!
                            

                              EVE ANDERSSON: By making our products more
                              accessible, weâre enabling people to learn more,
                              to accomplish more in their lives.
                            

                              FEMALE VOICE: I have a custom voice model now.
                              Take a selfie!
                            

                              ERNEST JOHNSON: Being able to set somebody on a
                              better path in their life, I can't put into words
                              the satisfaction you get from something like that.
                            

                              THOMAS PANEK: The safest thing for a blind person
                              to do is to sit still. I ain't sitting still.
                            

                              CASSANDRA JOHNSON: No matter what background you
                              are, your experiences, at the core of it is your
                              heart and your soul.
                            

                              FEMALE VOICE: Letâs try it out and see how it
                              goes.
                            
VOICE: Letâs do this.

                              MICHAEL BRENNER: This is only the tip of the
                              iceberg. Weâll learn lessons, which we can then
                              combine to build something that really works for
                              everyone.
                            

                              DMITRI KANEVSKY: To understand and be understood,
                              itâs absolutely unbelievable.
                            










                  Belonging is not just critical to our survival, itâs essential
                  if we are to thrive.

                                  As of 2021, we've reached our goal of
                                  improving leadership representation of
                                    Black+, Latino+, and Native American+
                                    Googlers by 30%, and we're on track to double Black+
                                  representation throughout our U.S. offices by
                                  2025.
                                

                                  As we work towards our representation goals,
                                  we're focusing on more than just hiring. Our
                                  recruiting leads are working closely with
                                  internal groups like the Black Googler Network
                                  to improve hiring, progression, and retention
                                  for underrepresented groups at Google. We're
                                  launching
                                  new onboarding programs
                                  for all Black Googlers, and doubling down on
                                  our commitment to support Googlers of color
                                  through expanded mental health resources, and
                                  through internal mentorship programs like
                                  Stay and Thrive. We're driving allyship and holding leaders
                                  accountable by incorporating diversity,
                                  equity, and inclusion into performance reviews
                                  for all vice president+ levels. We're also
                                  focusing on hiring more employees of color in
                                  key growth sites, and we're working with external partner
                                  organizations and Minority Serving
                                  Institutions in order to
                                  strengthen pathways to careers in tech
                                  for those historically excluded from the
                                  industry.

                                  American businesses added features like these

                                  Googlers with disabilities make critical
                                  contributions across the company. Weâre
                                  actively working to make Google a place where
                                  everyone can learn, grow, and have an impact.
                                  Here are a few ways weâre doing it:
                                



                                      Launched a new

                                      disabilities, including information about
                                      workplace accommodations




                                      Created a training on

                                      for managers at Google, then partnered
                                      with Disability:In to make the course
                                      available to their partner companies.

                                  The stories we tell shape the way we see each
                                  other and ourselves. Representing people with
                                  disabilities authentically and with respect
                                  for their full identities is an essential part
                                  of building more disability inclusion in the
                                  world.
                                

                                  Weâve officially partnered with
                                  LaVant Consulting, a disability-focused strategy and
                                  communications firm founded by
                                  AndraÃ©a LaVant
                                  (she/her), to guide our work in disability
                                  representation. With the help of LaVant
                                  Consulting, we are featuring stories that show
                                  how people in the disability community are
                                  driving accessibility in the world.
                                

                                  In 2021, we also launched
                                  All In, our inclusive marketing toolkit, which
                                  shares our learnings and ongoing work to
                                  improve representation of people with
                                  disabilities, as well as other groups who are
                                  marginalized by structural inequalities due to
                                  their identities. We worked with Disability:In
                                  to create specific guidelines for
                                  eliminating stereotypes in representations
                                    of people with disabilities, and share these insights in the hopes of
                                  driving progress in the industry overall.

                                  2020 was our

                                  women in tech, and we know that equity doesnât
                                  end with hiring. Thatâs why weâre focused on
                                  ensuring fairness throughout the employee
                                  lifecycle to help women and gender-expansive

                                      Weâve ensured

                                      for all women employees globally since
                                      2017, and have shared our approach
                                      for others to use.
                                    



                                      Weâve created targeted career development
                                      and promotion programs for women Googlers
                                      at every hiring level, from entry-level to
                                      director.
                                    



                                      Weâve created internal policies to
                                      alleviate stressors that tend to
                                      disproportionately impact women. For
                                      example, we expanded our Carerâs Leave
                                      from 4 to 14 weeks of paid time away with
                                      reimbursement for up to 20 days of
                                      caregiver costs.

                                      in the workplace, we overhauled our
                                      internal processes
                                      and added
                                      new care programs
                                      for people who report concerns.
                                    



                                      Weâre cultivating community through
                                      conferences like
                                      Transcend, our first Women of Color Summit, and

                                      Weâve engaged over 4,000 Google managers

                                  Nearly all forms of online violence
                                  disproportionately affect vulnerable
                                    groups
                                  like women and others who are marginalized due
                                  to their gender. As part of its mission to
                                  address threats to open societies,
                                  Jigsaw
                                  (a team within Google) is working toward
                                  globally scalable solutions to the issue of
                                    online toxicity.
                                



                                      The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) was
                                      commissioned by Jigsaw to study
                                      prevalence of online violence against
                                        women.
                                    



                                      To help spot abusive content at the scale
                                      that online content requires, Jigsaw
                                      created
                                      Perspective, an API that uses machine learning to
                                      help mitigate toxicity and abuse on online
                                      platforms. Jigsaw also worked with several
                                      NGOs, tech industry partners, and a group
                                      of highly targeted journalists to develop
                                      Harassment Manager, an open-source tool that allows users
                                      to document and manage abuse targeted at
                                      them on social media
                                    



                                      To provide women with tools to be safer
                                      and thrive online, Jigsaw teamed up with
                                      Women Techmakers
                                      to create the
                                      Womenâs Online Safety Program. This program, embraced at Google
                                      offices around the world, includes
                                      training
                                      on how to push back against online
                                      violence and

                                  In 2021, we launched the

                                    Girls, which focused on gender inequity, one of
                                  the most urgent challenges we face as a
                                  society. The challenge, launched in
                                  partnership with Vital Voices and Project
                                  Everyone, was an open call to organizations
                                  that create pathways to prosperity for women
                                  and girls. Thirty-four organizations have been
                                  selected and will receive between $300,000 and
                                  $1 million in funding, plus opportunities for
                                  mentorship and additional support from Google.

                            building in a way that sets the right standard.â
                          


















                      âWe all know what it feels like to be on the low end of
                      the power slider. And so we should lean on that empathy to
                      make sure that we're creating an environment in which
                      other people belong.â

                      âWhen I think about belonging, I think about the moments
                      when I see myself reflected in the spaces and places that
                      Iâm engaged in. I think about when I can create a sense of
                      familia within the spaces that I occupy and when I can
                      truly be myself in those spaces.â

Google employeeâs quote






Building a world where everyone can belong means ensuring
                    that no one is left out and each person has what they need
                    to thrive. We don't yet know how we'll get there,
                    but we know it can only be together.
