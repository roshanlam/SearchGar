                                  Creator Basics: How to Set Up and Customize
                                  Your Channel
                                





                              There are a few ways to get started on YouTube. We
                              offer up different formats and functionalities,
                              giving you the flexibility to create everything
                              from Shorts, which are vertical videos that run 60
                              seconds or less, to longer form videos.
                            

                              No matter what youâre creating, youâll need to
                              start by creating a YouTube Channel.
                            


                                First you need to sign into YouTube using a
                                Google Account.
                              

                                Once youâre signed in, click âCreate Accountâ,
                                and choose whether itâs for you or for your
                                business.
                              

                                You can then create a YouTube channel on your
                                account, upload videos, leave comments, and
                                create Shorts and playlists.
                              

Next, youâll want to upload your videos!


                                Uploading is easy. You just sign into your
                                YouTube account and then click on the âCreateâ
                                icon.
                              

                                If youâre planning to upload a longer form
                                video, select âupload videoâ and then choose
                                your desired video file - you can upload 15
                                files at a time!
                              

                                If youâd like to
                                upload a YouTube Short, youâll need to be signed into YouTube mobile,
                                where youâll tap âCreateâ and then âCreate a
                                Shortâ. From here you can either upload a video
                                from your camera roll or create using our suite
                                of lightweight tools.
                              



















                                  Help Your Videos Stand Out & Keep Viewers
                                  Watching
                                





                              Growing your channel is all about creating videos
                              viewers want to watch and accurately presenting
                              them to the audience. When doing so, hereâs a few
                              tips to keep in mind.
                            

                              With each video, think carefully about the title,
                              description, and
                              thumbnail
                              you plan to use - these should all accurately
                              reflect your content and let viewers know what
                              they can expect from the video. If youâre a Shorts
                              creator, think about how the first 1-2 seconds of
                              your content can grab viewers scrolling through
                              the video feed!
                            

                              Once youâve got viewers watching, you can redirect
                              their attention via hashtags,
                              playlists,
                              cards,
                              end screens, and more.
                            


















                                  Navigating YouTube Studio
                                





                              YouTube Studio is your home base for posting
                              videos and making edits to your channel. To update
                              your channelâs basic info like name,
                              profile picture, and banner, just log in and tap âCustomisationâ
                              to see your options.
                            

                              You can also make changes to your channel using
                              the Studio Mobile app. You can tap âYour Channelâ
                              and then âEdit Channelâ to update and edit how
                              your channel looks to your viewers. Note that you
                              can only change your channelâs name three times
                              every 90 days.

                              Promoting your videos is all about getting the
                              word out there. On YouTube, you can use tools like
                              cards, end screens, Stories, and Community Posts
                              to drive viewers to a specific piece of content!
                            

                              Off-platform, think about promoting your videos on
                              your socials and relevant communities, podcasts,
                              or platforms that align with your content and your
                              intended audience.

                                  The Algorithm
                                





                              Our search and discovery systems are built to find
                              videos that match viewersâ individual interests.
                              We
                              recommend videos
                              based on things such as: what your audience
                              watches and doesnât watch, how much time they
                              spend watching, what they like and dislike, if
                              they mark a video as ânot interestedâ, and on
                              satisfaction surveys.
                            

                              So, rather than trying trying to find a secret
                              code to these systems, focus instead on making
                              videos that you think will resonate with your
                              audience. A great tool here is YouTube Analytics,
                              which provides data that can help you understand
                              how your existing content is performing and
                              provide insights for future videos!

                              You can then create a YouTube channel on your

                            reflect your content and let viewers know what they
                            can expect from the video. If youâre a Shorts
                            creator, think about how the first 1-2 seconds of
                            your content can grab viewers scrolling through the
                            video feed!
                          

                            Once youâve got viewers watching, you can redirect
                            their attention via hashtags,
                            playlists,
                            cards,
                            end screens, and more.

                      How do I make edits to my channel?
                    




















                                Navigating YouTube Studio
                              







                            YouTube Studio is your home base for posting videos
                            and making edits to your channel. To update your
                            channelâs basic info like name,
                            profile picture, and banner, just log in and tap âCustomisationâ
                            to see your options.
                          

                            You can also make changes to your channel using the
                            Studio Mobile app. You can tap âYour Channelâ and
                            then âEdit Channelâ to update and edit how your
                            channel looks to your viewers. Note that you can
                            only change your channelâs name three times every 90
                            days.

                      How do I promote my videos?
                    













                            Promoting your videos is all about getting the word
                            out there. On YouTube, you can use tools like cards,
                            end screens, Stories, and Community Posts to drive
                            viewers to a specific piece of content!
                          

                            Off-platform, think about promoting your videos on
                            your socials and relevant communities, podcasts, or
                            platforms that align with your content and your
                            intended audience.

                      How does the algorithm work?
                    




















                                The Algorithm
                              







                            Our search and discovery systems are built to find
                            videos that match viewersâ individual interests. We
                            recommend videos
                            based on things such as: what your audience watches
                            and doesnât watch, how much time they spend
                            watching, what they like and dislike, if they mark a
                            video as ânot interestedâ, and on satisfaction
                            surveys.
                          

                            So, rather than trying trying to find a secret code
                            to these systems, focus instead on making videos
                            that you think will resonate with your audience. A
                            great tool here is YouTube Analytics, which provides
                            data that can help you understand how your existing
                            content is performing and provide insights for
                            future videos!
