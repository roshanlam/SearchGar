Jen



                Let me just take this moment to say that is better than ALL of these other platforms. You can watch all your shows live, set your favs to record like a DVR, or just find shows on there the day after they air. Itâs fabulous. ð

Can I watch YouTube TV while traveling?



YouTube TV works everywhere in the U.S., with live TV offered in areas where we’re launched. Your access to local networks will vary depending on which zip code you're in. Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you’ll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.)

Additional programming and ads








Are shows available on-demand?



Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand.






Does YouTube TV have ads?



Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos.






Can I fast-forward through ads?



Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings—including upcoming airings and reruns—will be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you’re not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos.
