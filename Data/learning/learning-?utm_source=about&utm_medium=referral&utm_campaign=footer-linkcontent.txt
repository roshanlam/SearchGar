Our Story

                Learning is more than just knowingâitâs the ongoing quest for understanding.
            

Over 20 years ago, we made it our mission to organize the worldâs information to make it universally accessible and useful. And today, billions of people come to Google and YouTube with the intent to learn. Our goal is to provide the information, tools and services that help them build knowledge, fuel curiosity, and prepare for whatâs next.
