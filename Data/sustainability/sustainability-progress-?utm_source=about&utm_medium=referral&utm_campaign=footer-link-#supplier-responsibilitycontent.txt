Carbon-free energy

Accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy.









In 2007, we became carbon neutral and in 2017, we became the first company of our size to match 100% of our global, annual electricity consumption with renewable energy. Today, we are the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. Now, weâre carving a path forward to decarbonize our electricity supply completely and operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy, everywhere, by 2030.

Conflict Minerals Report
Conflict Minerals Report
Most electronics contain tantalum, tin, tungsten and/or gold. These metals can be sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries where a decades-long civil war is being waged and where various groups are fighting to control the mineral trade. We believe it is essential to establish in-region conflict-free sources of these metals to protect human rights.
